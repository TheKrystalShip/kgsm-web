// Service worker for the standalone Krystal Assistant PWA.
//
// Same job as the Control Panel's (public/sw.js): satisfy the browser's installability criteria
// with a functional `fetch` handler, and give an offline-launchable app shell — without ever
// touching the live data path.
//
// ⚠ IT DIFFERS FROM THE PANEL'S IN THE ONE WAY THAT MATTERS, and the difference is not stylistic.
// The panel is served by kgsm-api, whose API lives under /api/ and /auth/, so a DENYLIST of those
// two prefixes is exhaustive. This surface is served BY THE LEAF IT TALKS TO, and the leaf's routes
// are UNPREFIXED AT THE ROOT — /turn, /confirm, /conversations, /tools, /health, /auth/*, /admin/*.
// A denylist there is wrong by default: every route the leaf grows is cached until someone
// remembers to add it, and a stale authenticated 200 both masks token expiry from the session layer
// and serves one person's conversation out of another's cache.
//
// So this ALLOWLISTS instead. Only the app shell and the static asset directories are ever
// intercepted; anything not named below reaches the network untouched, which is the safe default
// for a route this file has never heard of.
//
// Not a Workbox precache — Vite's content-hashed assets are cached on demand (cache-first is safe
// because their URL changes when their content does); the shell is network-first so a deploy lands
// on the next online load.

// watching this decision anywhere.
//
// ⚠ Every payload here is a CAPABILITY. `confirm` and `cancel` are single-use handles that act
// without a session — which is the only way a worker can act at all — so they are never logged,
// never put in a URL, and never survive the notification they arrived on.
//
// ⚠ The clock is the whole design constraint. A staged action lives five minutes, so these buttons
// go stale on their own and tapping a stale one is an ORDINARY outcome, not an error: it gets a
// plain sentence, the same as a successful one would.
