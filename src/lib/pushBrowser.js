// pushBrowser.js — the browser half of Web Push, with no opinion about which backend it talks to.
//
// Both surfaces in this tree do the same three awkward things: work out whether this browser can
// receive a push at all, get a subscription bound to the right application server key, and give it
// up again. What differs is only the transport — the panel asks kgsm-api, the standalone assistant
// asks the leaf, and the two answer on different routes with different shapes. So the transport
// arrives as a parameter, exactly the way `assistantSession.setOriginResolver` takes its address
// lookup, and this module imports NOTHING.
//
// ⚠ That last part is structural, not tidiness. `npm run check:assistant` walks the standalone
// import graph and fails on the panel's roots; a shared module that reached `apiClient` would drag
// the whole cluster model into a surface that has no nodes.
//
// Two platform rules, both load-bearing:
//   - Permission must be requested from a real user gesture. A prompt on load gets denied, and a
//     denied permission is close to unrecoverable — the browser stops asking and the person has to
//     find it in site settings.
//   - Chrome requires `userVisibleOnly: true`, so every push shows a notification. This cannot be a
//     quiet data channel.

 *   "unsupported"   — no service worker or no Push API at all
 *   "needs-install" — iOS Safari in a tab: supported once added to the Home Screen
 *   "denied"        — permission was refused; we cannot re-prompt
 *   "ready"         — can subscribe (permission granted, or still unasked)
 *
 * ⚠ "needs-install" is its own state rather than folded into "unsupported" because on iOS the
 * feature is not missing, it is one step away — and telling somebody it is unsupported when the fix
 * is "add to Home Screen" is telling them something false.
