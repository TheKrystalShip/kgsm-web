// toasts.js — transient outcome messages, and the history that outlives them.
//
// THE RULE: a toast reports the outcome of something YOU DID. It never reports
// something that merely happened. Fleet events already have homes (the Alerts
// feed, the live tiles, Recent activity); routing those through here would bury
// the panel under cards during a mass restart.
//
// It exists for the SHELL-LEVEL handlers. Every write path that owns a component
// already renders its own error next to the control that failed, which is the
// better place for it — see ConsolePanel, ServerNotice, PlayersTab,
// ServerSettings. App.jsx's lifecycle and install handlers own no control, which
// is exactly why they used to swallow their errors, and why they need this.
//
// The HISTORY is client-side on purpose, and it is not a duplicate of the audit
// log. kgsm-api writes an audit row from the ENGINE ECHO, so every command it
// refuses up front — unknown verb, unknown server, an inadmissible no-op, or a
// command already in flight — is answered and dropped before the engine is ever
// touched, and no audit row is ever written for it. Those refusals exist nowhere
// but here. The audit log remains the authority for what actually happened to
// the fleet; this is the record of what you asked for and how it went.
//
// Dependency-free beyond store.js so BOTH surfaces can hold it (the standalone
// assistant must not reach the Control Panel's data layer — see src/CLAUDE.md).
