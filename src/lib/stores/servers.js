// ---- Game servers -------------------------------------------------------

// A job is what is being DONE to a server; status is what the server IS. The backend keeps them apart
// (its status vocabulary is run-state only — running/starting/stopped/unknown), and this module is the
// ONE place they are joined: while a job owns a server, the row's status reads as that job's state, so
// every surface — the hero pill, the tiles, the sidebar dot, the filters — shows the operation in
// progress without each of them re-deriving it.
//
// Every verb here is one whose run-state alone reads WRONG for as long as the job lasts: a server being
// shut down is still genuinely "running" (the process is up, draining and saving its world), an
// instance being updated is genuinely "stopped", and one being restarted reads as whichever side of
// the bounce it happens to be on — none of that is what an operator who just pressed the button needs
// to see. An instance being installed is the sharpest case of all: the engine writes its config before
// it downloads a byte, so it joins the roster measurably-stopped while several minutes of download
// remain, and its run-state says "offline" about a server that has never existed. `start` is the one
// lifecycle verb absent, because the backend already has an honest run-state for it: "starting", the
// watchdog's own boot window, which says more than a job would.
const JOB_STATUS = {
  install: "installing", update: "updating", stop: "stopping", restart: "restarting",
  // The two backup verbs. Archiving or replacing a world is minutes on a large one, and the engine
  // now brackets both, so a run driven from the CLI or the scheduler arrives here as a job like any
  // other — and a row that reads plain "Online" through it invites somebody to restart the server
  // out from under an archive being written.
  backup_create: "backing-up", backup_restore: "restoring",
  // Moving an instance onto another disk. The sharpest case after install, and the reason this map
  // exists at all: the engine STARTS the server once on its new path to confirm it runs there, so
  // run-state genuinely reads "online" and then "offline" partway through a copy nobody has finished.
  // A row following run-state alone flickers; the job's span is the whole operation.
  move: "moving",
};

// How long a job we know about locally survives a server frame that carries none. The backend carries the
// active job on every server read, so an in-flight job normally re-arrives with each frame; this window
// only covers the gap between issuing a command and the first frame that includes it (a frame built
// before the command landed would otherwise wipe the state the operator just triggered).

// transitional pill on a server that is running normally and may stay queued for as long as the work
// ahead of it takes. What a queued job changes is the BUTTONS — the verb is committed, and the row
