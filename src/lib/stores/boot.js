// None of this runs at import. A browser on the node or sign-in screen has no identity
// and has not necessarily chosen a host yet, so hydrating stores and dialling one SSE
// stream per connection would be traffic on behalf of nobody: every call 401s, every
// stream backs off and retries forever, and none of it can succeed until somebody signs
// in. The shell calls startDataLayer() once it has a live session, and stopDataLayer()
// when it loses one.
//
// Both are idempotent, because the shell may mount twice (StrictMode) and a session can
// be lost and regained without a reload.
