// stores/selection.js — the set of servers one gesture is about to act on.
//
// A selection is CLUSTER-WIDE: seventeen servers over three nodes, six of them needing an update, is
// one selection and one confirm. So every entry carries the node its server belongs to — the
// dispatcher groups by that, and a run that crosses nodes is N requests rather than a relay.
//
// Three rules, and each one exists because its opposite is a way to act on a server nobody meant:
//
//   · CLEARED ON FILTER CHANGE. A selected row hidden behind a filter is invisible consent. The page
//     that owns the filters clears this when any of them moves.
//   · NEVER PERSISTED. It is a gesture, not a preference — nothing here touches localStorage, unlike
//     the favourites store this is otherwise shaped after.
//   · A FINISHED RUN NARROWS IT TO WHAT STILL NEEDS DOING. Rows that succeeded drop out, rows that
//     failed stay, and a clean run leaves nothing selected. Retry is then one click that can only
//     address what actually needs retrying — a selection still holding the successes would re-run the
//     verb against servers already done.
