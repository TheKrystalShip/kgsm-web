// stores/prefs.js — the account's preferences, held locally and mirrored to the node.
//
// LOCAL-FIRST, and that is the whole design. A preference is read on the very first render — the
// dashboard's layout decides what to mount — so waiting for a round trip would mean an empty
// dashboard on every cold load, and a failed round trip would mean an empty dashboard forever. So
// localStorage is the source the app reads, always and synchronously; the node is where the value
// is kept so it can outlive the browser and follow the person to their other devices.
//
// A write lands locally and returns. The PUT that follows is best-effort: it can fail, and when it
// does nothing is lost — the value is already where the app reads it, and the next successful write
// carries it up. Nothing here blocks, retries in a loop, or shows an error for a preference that is
// already saved where it matters.
//
// The panel can also be pointed at NO node, or at one that is down, and it must stay fully usable.
// That is not a degraded mode to apologise for; it is the offline case working.
