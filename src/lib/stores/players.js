// stores/players.js — one server's player roster, keyed, shared by everything that wants it.
//
// Keyed for the reason every store here is keyed: a roster held in one slot works while exactly one
// surface reads it, and stops the moment a second can. The Players tab and the command palette can
// both be looking at the same server at once — the palette opens over the page it is scoped to — and
// two readers fighting over one slot would each blank the other's roster with no error to show for
// it. Two DIFFERENT servers at once has the same shape and the same answer.
//
// It pairs with `useKeyedResource`: keying is what lets two targets coexist, and that is what stops
// N mounts of the same target hydrating N times.
//
// TAIL-THEN-FOLLOW, and the ORDER IS A RACE. `acquire` calls hydrate() and follow() back to back
// and neither waits, so live frames start arriving while the REST read is still in flight. A frame
// applied before the roster lands would be overwritten by it — somebody would join, and then
// silently un-join when the hydrate finished. So frames are BUFFERED until the read completes and
// replayed in order behind it. The same guarantee ConsolePanel's tail makes, for the same reason.
