// ---- Cluster discovery --------------------------------------------------
// The node set the SPA drives is the CLUSTER's, not the list of addresses this
// browser happens to have been pointed at. Ask any node we can reach for the
// converged roster and register the peers it names; the connection set grows in
// place, so every surface fans out over them from the next read on.
//
// Runs for every tier — a viewer resolves the same roster through the
// viewer-safe path inside fetchRoster. Nodes are tried in order and the FIRST
// that answers wins: the roster is converged, so any reachable node's view is
// the cluster's view. All nodes failing is not an error state here — an
// unreachable cluster is already surfaced by the connection banner, and a
// roster we could not read must not clear or contradict one we already have.
//
// The connection set FOLLOWS the roster (see reconcileRosterToRegistry): an alive
// + reachable peer carrying both a nodeId and a client URL is registered, and a
// node the roster no longer names is dropped. A peer we cannot verify stays a
// visible ghost on the Cluster page rather than becoming a dead connection; a
// member that is merely unwell keeps its connection, because being unreachable is
// not the same as having left.
// Only a connection whose BACKEND id is reconciled can be asked (api.peers
// requires a concrete id) — the seed starts id-less and GET /hosts fills it in.
