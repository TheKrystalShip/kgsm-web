// stores/batches.js — the batch records this browser can see, and which nodes it could ask.
//
// A batch is one node's share of a run: the node records it, paces it and completes it whether or
// not anyone is watching. This store holds what the panel has been told about those records — the
// `202` that accepted one, the rows a read returns, and the `batch.patch` frames a node pushes as
// its members move.
//
// ── Hydrate, then follow ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `refresh()` fans `GET /batches?active=true` across every connection and keeps each node's answer
// under that node's id. Hydration is what makes a run visible to a client that was not open when it
// started — which is the reader this exists for. A view assembled from frames alone shows nothing to
// the browser that arrived second, and nothing at all to a different person.
//
// ── A node that did not answer is stated, never subtracted ────────────────
//
// `nodes` holds the last fan-out's per-connection outcome. A run reassembled while one node is
// unreachable is a run whose share on that node is UNKNOWN, not a run with fewer members — so the
// surface reads the failures out of here and says so, rather than drawing a smaller run and letting
// it pass for the whole one.
//
// ── The node is the authority for its own active set ──────────────────────
//
// A batch this browser holds as active which the node no longer lists is re-read individually rather
// than dropped: it settled, and how it settled is the node's to say. Dropping it would make a run
// vanish mid-glance, and marking it settled here would be this browser inventing an outcome.
//
// Two more questions are asked of it: a batch's member count, so a queued button can say "3rd of 8"
// instead of guessing a denominator, and whether every batch of a run has settled, which is what
// lets a run narrow the selection to what still needs doing.
