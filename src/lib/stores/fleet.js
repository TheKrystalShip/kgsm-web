// The band's other eight tiles derive from stores the app already holds (the roster, the audit
// feed, the host capability block). These four have no such source and are all slow-moving
// facts — a week's uptime, a supervision table, a maintenance-window board, a systemd board — so they
// are fetched together on one lazy loop rather than four eager ones.
//
// Every slice is independently fallible and independently honest. A node whose watchdog is not
// running still reports its maintenance windows; the slice that failed is `null`, which the tiles read as
// "not measured" and never as zero. That is the same degradation rule the leaf pages follow —
// nothing here can turn one absent leaf into a fleet-wide blank.
