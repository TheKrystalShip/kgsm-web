// config.js — runtime wiring config: the set of kgsm-api hosts the SPA talks to.
//
// The SPA is a multi-host client (one kgsm-api == one host's aggregator): the
// source of truth is a RUNTIME registry of connected hosts in localStorage.
// There is no single global base URL; each host carries its own. An empty
// registry means no host is connected yet → the app shows the connect screen.
//
//   VITE_API_BASE — OPTIONAL single-host SEED (origin, no /api/v1). When the
//                   registry is empty it stands in as one connection — how the
//                   smoke:live harness points the app at a backend, and a handy
//                   dev shortcut.
//
// CONNECTIONS is seeded once at module load and then GROWS IN PLACE as cluster
// discovery converges on the roster: the array identity never changes, so every
// consumer that holds the import — routing, fan-out, the SSE registry — sees a
// node the moment it is registered. Connect and disconnect still do a FULL PAGE
// RELOAD (they change identity and auth, exactly as login / logout / session-loss
// do); an appended peer needs no reload because nothing about the session changes.
// Subscribe with subscribeConnections() to hold per-connection resources.

// probing GET /hosts at connect time), `url` an origin (with or without scheme).
