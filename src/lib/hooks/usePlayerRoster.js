// The SHAPE of what this returns is unchanged and deliberately so: `{ status, detection, moderation,
// players }`, exactly as before. What changed is underneath — the fetch and the `players`
// subscription used to be this hook's own local state, so two surfaces reading the same server read
// it twice. They now share a keyed store (stores/players.js) through `useKeyedResource`, which is
// what makes one hydrate and one subscription serve every reader.
//
// That mattered the moment the command palette could be scoped to a server: the palette opens OVER
// the page it is scoped to, so the Players tab and the palette are routinely mounted against the
// same server at once.
//
// Re-exported here rather than moved, so every existing call site keeps working untouched.
