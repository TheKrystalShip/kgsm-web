// useJobPhase — the three states a lifecycle control is drawn in: idle · queued · running.
//
// Two, historically, and it was harmless: every surface derived pending work as
// `job.state === "running"`, so a queued job rendered as idle — no spinner, no label, live buttons —
// and `queued` lasted milliseconds. A batch makes it last as long as the work ahead of it takes. A
// server eighth in a stop queue looked like nothing was happening to it, with a Stop button inviting
// a command the node would refuse.
//
// So the phase is derived ONCE, here, and the surfaces that draw a button read it: the tile, the
// cinematic hero, and an alert card's suggested action. A fourth derivation is how one of them comes
// to disagree with the others about a server nobody is watching.
//
// `queuedTotal` is the batch's member count. It is absent until a node has stated it — through the
// accept that named the admitted members, or a `batch.patch` frame — and the label then reads "3rd"
// rather than inventing a denominator.
