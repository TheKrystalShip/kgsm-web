// and a missing entry paints a destructive act neutral, which is a lie. Keyed by dimension the
// table is closed while the vocabulary stays open: an event this build has never heard of lands on
// an entry that already exists, because the entry describes a KIND of thing rather than a thing.

// Severity is the producer's judgement and nothing here second-guesses it — the scheduler knows its
// prune is routine and the engine knows an uninstall is not, and that knowledge exists nowhere
// else. Outcome only separates a good routine fact from a neutral one, so a success lifts a routine
// row to green and changes nothing louder; a `success` in the severity field says the same thing
// about the same row and reads the same green.
//
// A row carrying no severity is `info` — the honest floor for an event nobody declared, never a
// weight guessed from what its name looks like it means.

// namespace would route its rows to the wrong glyph. An irregular past tense is out of a stem's
// reach, so it is a second key onto the same glyph. The longest key matching a segment wins at that
// level, and the walk stops at the deepest node it reaches — an unrecognised segment falls back to
// the namespace above it, and a name in no namespace at all falls to the root glyph. Plain, and

// ---------- The card ramp ----------

//
//   • It RESCALES in both directions. A raw byte count is unreadable at a glance ("123245" tells you
//     nothing until you have counted the digits), so the unit follows the value up and back down.
//   • It is NEVER wider than four characters, which is what lets a chip reserve a fixed box and stop
//     the row from shuffling every time a value gains a digit. Two rules keep that promise: only
//     values under 10 carry a decimal, and a value that would round to four digits is promoted to the
//     next unit instead (1023 B is "1.0K", never "1023B").
//
// Precision is deliberately traded for stillness — the exact figure goes in the chip's tooltip and on
// the Performance tab. Null-in / em-dash out, so a caller can never turn "not measured" into "0B".
// Runs to P because the four-character promise has to hold at the TOP of the ramp too: the largest
// unit has nothing to be promoted into, so whatever it is prints five characters past 999.5 of it.
