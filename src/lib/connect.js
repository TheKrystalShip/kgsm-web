// probe + the registry/identity writes. The pure helpers are unit-testable;
// connectHost is the impure orchestrator (fetch injectable).
//
// SCOPE: the auth-DISABLED connect path is the live one. A real auth-enabled
// host returns 401 from /me (no bearer yet) and completing Discord OAuth needs a
// backend token-handoff that isn't built (WIRING §6) — so we surface that
// honestly ("needs_auth") rather than bounce into a flow that can't finish.

// addresses this browser has been pointed at over its lifetime — so this both
// registers the peers a roster names and drops the ones it no longer names.
//
// JOINING is deliberately conservative: only an enabled node carrying BOTH a
// nodeId and a clientUrl, and reading BOTH alive (gossip membership) AND reachable
// (status probe), is registered. That is the one legitimate vouch target, and it is
// the only state in which adding a URL cannot strand a dead connection that trips
// the app-wide banner and never self-heals. A node missing either field, or not yet
// verified, stays a visible ghost on the Cluster page instead — never fabricated
// into a connection.
//
// LEAVING is a different question from being unwell, and the two must not be
// collapsed. A node absent from the roster has left the cluster: it was removed, it
// departed, or it was reaped, and either way it is no longer a member and nothing
// should still be counting it, streaming from it, or naming it in a banner. A
// departure is also announced BEFORE the row disappears — a graceful leave is
// recorded as a `left` tombstone that propagates and is only reaped minutes later,
// so that a row vanishing locally and returning cannot be mistaken for a member
// coming back. That tombstone is a departure the moment it is read, not a member to
// keep driving until the reaper gets to it. A node PRESENT in the roster and
// unreachable, suspect or dead is still a member having trouble — dead is refutable
// and a returning member beats it — so it keeps its connection and keeps being
// reported, which is what those surfaces exist for.
//
// Only entries the cluster taught us are dropped this way (`via: "roster"`). An
// address a person typed, or the build's seed, is theirs to remove; a roster that
// does not mention it is not a statement about it.
//
// Idempotent: dedupes by normalized origin AND by existing id, so repeated calls on
// every roster poll converge rather than churn. opts.localHostId is the node whose
// roster this is — it is never in its own roster, so it is neither added nor
// dropped. A joined node enters the LIVE connection set at once and a departed one
// leaves it, so the fan-out and the stream registry follow with no reload.
//
// ONLY NODES BECOME CONNECTIONS. A cluster's members are nodes and anchors, and a
// connection is a thing this app drives — it asks it for hosts, servers and metrics
// and opens a live channel to it. An anchor serves none of that: it provides one
// capability to the whole cluster and answers on its own surface. Registering one
// makes every fan-out call it, every count include it, and its absent live channel
// name it in the connectivity banner forever.
// A member is a node unless it says otherwise. A roster row from a build that
// predates the field carries no kind, and every member in such a cluster is a node —
// so the absent value reads as one rather than excluding the whole roster.
