// leaves.js — the leaf/service vocabulary shared by every surface that shows a KGSM leaf:
// the Services board's cards, the leaf page, and the leaf configuration page. Pure data +
// pure functions, no React and no API.
//
// It lives in lib/ rather than beside any one of those surfaces because all three read it,
// and because `components/LeafCard.jsx` may not import from a page.

// ---- Run state ----------------------------------------------------------
// systemd's own word for the unit, folded to a tone + a label. `idle` (socket-activated,
// resting) is deliberately neutral — it is not a fault — and nothing is green by default:
// an unknown or missing unit is muted, never optimistic.
const SVC_STATE = {
  active:          { tone: "up",   label: "Running" },
  activating:      { tone: "warn", label: "Starting" },
  deactivating:    { tone: "warn", label: "Stopping" },
  reloading:       { tone: "warn", label: "Reloading" },
  maintenance:     { tone: "warn", label: "Maintenance" },
  failed:          { tone: "down", label: "Failed" },

// The unit's state joined with the api's deep-health probe where it has one. A leaf that is
// up but failing its probe is a warning, not a success — and a leaf the api cannot probe
// keeps its systemd answer rather than being downgraded for a measurement nobody took.

// ---- Iconography & kind -------------------------------------------------
// Purely presentational, like LOG_SOURCE_META's labels — the backend serves neither an icon
// nor a category and neither is domain data. A leaf that isn't listed falls back to the
// generic icon and shows no kind at all, so a leaf joining the ecosystem later still renders
// correctly without a frontend change.

// rather than repeating it, and it is not the leaf's `role` — that sentence is the card's body.
