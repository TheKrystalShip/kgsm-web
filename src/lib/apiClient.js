// apiClient.js — the single seam between the client and the backend.

// Everything that talks to the server goes through `api`: REST over fetch
// (translated by adapters.js) and realtime over one WebSocket per connected host
// (liveStream.js). The call sites (the domain stores) only ever see `api`. See
// architecture.html (§3, §3·b).

  // ---- connection health (drives the resilience layer) -------------------
  // connectionStore is REST reachability, the reactive signal the shell reads:
  // 'connecting' (booting), 'live' (reachable), 'down' (unreachable). `everLoaded`
  // separates a COLD start (never succeeded → full takeover) from a WARM drop
  // (succeeded before → non-blocking banner). Updated as a side effect of traffic.
  //
  // Reachability is tracked PER CONNECTION (the `hosts` map) and the global summary
  // is AGGREGATED from it: 'live' when ANY connection answers, 'down' ONLY when every
  // known connection is unreachable. This mirrors realtimeStore's per-host model —
  // one down host (a federated peer that's offline, a background fan-out probe that
  // fails) must never flip the whole shell to "Can't reach Krystal" while the host
  // you're actually on is fine. Its own surfaces carry the per-host degraded state.

    everLoaded: false,
    failures: 0,
    retrying: false,
    hosts: {},   // per-connection reachability: { [hostId]: "live" | "down" }
  });

  // ---- realtime channel health (PER-HOST WebSocket + the browser online state) --
  // Distinct from REST reachability above. realtimeStore answers "is the live
  // PUSH channel up?" — and that channel is PER HOST: the panel is a sink
  // aggregating N hosts, each running its own agent over its own WebSocket. One
  // host's link can drop while the others keep streaming, so there is no single
  // global "live" state — only `online` (does the BROWSER have a network at all?)
  // plus a per-host socket mode. When a host's link drops we don't blank its data:
  // on reconnect the socket re-subscribes + re-hydrates the REST stores. This is
  // the "Realtime fallback" promised in architecture.html (§3·j).
  //
  //   per host →  'live'         socket connected, that host is pushing
  //               'reconnecting' its link dropped but we're online — backing off
  //   global   →  'offline'      the browser itself reports no network

  // refuses the session, or errors: the rows that node owns are simply absent.
  // On a list with no node dimension on screen that is indistinguishable from
  // "those servers are gone" — a fabricated state. So every fan-out records its
  // per-node outcome here and the aggregated surfaces disclose it. Absence of
  // data is never the signal; this is the measurement.

  //   unreachable  transport failure — no answer at all
  //   unauthorized the node refused the session (401/403)
  //   error        the node answered, with a failure
  // Keyed by the connection's URL, not its id: a connection's backend id is null
  // until GET /hosts reconciles it, so id-keying would strand the reads taken
