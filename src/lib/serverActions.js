// serverActions.js — running a lifecycle verb against a server, from anywhere.
//
// The optimistic patch, the rollback and the error wording are not presentation: they are what the
// action IS, and every surface that offers a Start button has to do all three or it lies about what
// happened. Holding them in the shell as a callback meant only a component the shell could reach
// was allowed to offer one — which stops working the moment a card can be pinned to the dashboard,
// with no shell above it to be handed anything.
//
// So this is a module, not a context: it needs nothing from React, and a call site imports it the
// same way it imports the store it is already reading.

/// settled job's `error` rather than as a rejected promise. Without this, a start the engine turned

/// cleared it, and the server sat at offline with the reason nowhere on screen.
