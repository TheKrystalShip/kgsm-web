// SettingsMemory.jsx — what the assistant has written down about you, on the leaf you're currently
// talking to, and the one place to correct it. Shared by both settings surfaces (the Control Panel's
// account page and the standalone assistant's own settings) so a change to how a memory reads lands
// on both — it depends on nothing but `assistantClient`, `settings-primitives`, `formatting` and the
// editor beside it, so it stays safe for the standalone surface (`npm run check:assistant`).
//
// The leaf, not this card, decides what "yours" means: `assistantClient.js` reaches it directly, the
// same seam a chat turn does, so this can only ever list, write or forget the caller's OWN memory.
//
// `hostId` is the leaf currently being talked to — a real host id in the panel, the fixed `"self"`
// key the standalone surface always uses. `connected` says whether that leaf is reachable right now,
// so the card can say why nothing loaded rather than just showing an empty list.
//
// **A memory belongs to one leaf, and the panel drives a cluster.** The defaults below describe the
// standalone surface, which has exactly one assistant and never has to say which — everything that
// makes this card cluster-aware is a prop the panel passes:
//
//   `hostName`   — whose assistant this is, named in the card so a reader is never left inferring it
//                  from whatever the chat dock happens to be pointed at.
//   `candidates` — how many hosts in the cluster run an assistant at all. It exists only to keep
//                  three different facts from wearing one label: nobody runs one, several do and
//                  none is picked, and one is picked but unreachable. The middle case is the trap —
//                  the dock deliberately leaves the target unset when several could answer, so a
//                  cluster full of healthy assistants would otherwise read as having none.
//   `onPickHost` — opens the surface that owns the choice (the chat, where the picker lives). The
//                  choice is not duplicated here: two places to set one target is how they come to
//                  disagree.
