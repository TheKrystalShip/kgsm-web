// ServerActions.jsx — confirm-first, job-aware lifecycle buttons.
//
// Shared by the server hero (big chips), the server tiles (quick row) and the
// alert cards (a firing condition's suggested action), so they never diverge.
// Two behaviours layered on a normal button:
//
//   1. Confirm-first (misclick guard). Verbs flagged `confirm` arm on the first
//      click — the button swaps in place to "Confirm?" — and only dispatch on a
//      second click. It reverts on its own after a short timeout. Start is NOT
//      gated by default (bringing a server up is safe); Stop/Restart/Update are.
//
//   2. Job progress, in THREE states rather than two: idle · queued · running.
//      While the server's command job is running (tracked on serversStore via the
//      `jobs` channel) the acting button shows a spinner and its pending label.
//      While it is QUEUED — a batch took it and has not reached it yet — the
//      button shows no spinner, because nothing is spinning, and states its place
//      in the line instead. Either way the sibling actions disable: the work is
//      committed whether or not it has started.

// verbGuard(server, verb) -> { disabled, reason } — whether this verb can run against
// this server right now, and the sentence explaining it when it can't.
//
// ONE answer for every surface that draws a lifecycle button. The hero, the server
// tile and an alert card's suggested action all ask here, so the same server can
// never offer Update in one place and refuse it in another. The gates, in order:
//
//   0. The verb's own action, held on this server (`verbRefusal`). Somebody may hold
//      start and not restart; the control stays on screen, closed, naming the action.
//   1. The watchdog mediates every lifecycle verb — with it down the supervisor
//      can't start, stop, restart or update anything.
//   2. The observed run state. kgsm refuses to update a RUNNING instance (the files
//      are in use) and kgsm-api's CommandGate 409s that synchronously, so pre-disable
//      here and say why rather than letting the click fail.
//   3. For update only: whether there is anything to apply.
//
// Whether any lifecycle control renders at all is `serverOperable`, a different question.

// verb: lifecycle verb · variant: "chip" | "glass" | "quick" | "alert" | "cta" · disabled: base guard

// queuedVerb: the verb of a job the node has taken but not started · queuedPosition/queuedTotal:
//        where it sits in that batch's line. The position is a COUNT, never a clock — ten servers
//        reading "queued" say nothing about which moves next, and no completion time is offered
//        because nothing here has measured how long a verb takes. The total is simply omitted until
//        a node has stated it, so the label degrades to the position rather than guessing at a
//        denominator.
// reason: optional tooltip shown when disabled (e.g. why the watchdog blocks it)
// label: overrides the verb's idle label only (the pending and armed words are the
//        verb's own, so a renamed button still reports the same action in flight)
//
// "glass" is the cinematic server-hero button — a ghost button with a tone-coloured
// icon that lives inside the hero's frosted control bar. "alert" is the suggested
// action on an alert card, wearing that card's own button chrome. "cta" is the
// full-width primary button a server card promotes into its connect row. All share
// the chip's confirm-first + pending behaviour (is-armed / is-pending); only the
// chrome differs, which is the point — a verb pressed anywhere behaves the same.
// `warn` turns a normally-unarmed verb into an arming one and supplies the sentence it arms WITH.
// Start uses it for the node-capacity hint: the panel cannot know a start will be refused — the
// reading is a moment old and the requirement may be a vendor estimate — so it must not DISABLE the
// button. Disabling on a prediction strands an operator with no way forward, while letting a doomed
// start through costs nothing: the engine refuses it, which is what the gate is for.
//
// Arming instead says what the panel knows and hands the decision back. Confirming passes
// { force: true } to onRun, since somebody who has read the numbers and pressed again IS the
// override.
