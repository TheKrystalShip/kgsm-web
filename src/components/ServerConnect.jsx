// game gets the connect address to copy, because joining happens in the game's own
// server browser. The panel never claims to have connected anyone — launching is
// fire-and-forget (the browser hands the steam:// handler off with no callback),
// and the address is the honest instruction underneath it. Both are gated on the
// server being online: there is nothing to join otherwise.
