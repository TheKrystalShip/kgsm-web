// SelectionBar — what is picked, and the four verbs that can be applied to it.
//
// It appears only when something is selected, because an always-present strip would charge the whole
// page for a gesture most visits never make. "Select all N matching" lives in the toolbar instead, for
// the opposite reason: it is how a selection STARTS, and a control that only appears once you have
// selected something cannot be the thing that starts one.
//
// A verb whose selection contains nothing it can run against is disabled and says how it counted. That
// is the same partition the preflight sheet draws, run early — a sheet that opens only to say "nothing
// in this selection can take stop" is a click spent on an answer the bar already had.
