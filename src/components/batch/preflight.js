// Rendered locally, decided remotely. Everything here is a PREDICTION the panel makes so it can
// explain itself: each node re-decides on arrival and its `refused[]` is the authority for its own
// servers. A row that goes offline between this partition and the submit is refused there and
// nowhere else, which is why the result surface reads the responses rather than assuming this held.
//
// It lives beside the components rather than in `lib/` because `verbGuard` does — one answer about
// whether a verb can run, shared by the hero, the tile, an alert card's suggested action and this.
// A second implementation here is exactly how a server comes to be refused in one place and offered
// in another.
