// RunsBoard — what the whole cluster is doing right now, and how it is going.
//
// A RUN is what a person started: one verb, one cluster-wide selection, one outcome. A BATCH is one
// node's share of it. Each node records its own share, knows nothing of the others, and stores the
// run id it was handed verbatim — so grouping on that id is what reassembles the run, including one
// this browser never dispatched, from another tab or another person.
//
// ── Hydrate, then follow ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The board reads `batchesStore`, which fans `GET /batches?active=true` across every connected node
// and follows the `batches` topic afterwards. Hydration is the whole point: a tray assembled from
// stream frames alone shows nothing to a client that opened after the run started, which is exactly
// the person this exists for.
//
// ── Not the Notifications tray ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// That one is per-browser `localStorage` and is explicitly what YOU did in THIS browser. This is
// server-side truth about the fleet: it survives the tab, and it holds work nobody here started.
// The distinction is why this is a dashboard widget somebody chooses to pin rather than a second
// tray in the sidebar's foot, where the two would read as one list.
//
// ── What a node's silence means ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A node the hydrate could not read is stated. Its share of a run is UNKNOWN, which is not the same
// as absent — drawing a three-node run as a two-node one would be this surface inventing the shape of
// somebody's action.

/// A batch verb, in the vocabulary every lifecycle button already uses. The batch verb set is the
/// same closed one a single command takes; anything else is rendered under its own wire word, since
/// the node said it and repeating it is honest where inventing a friendly name is not.
