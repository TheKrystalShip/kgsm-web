// PlayerModeration — the per-row kick/ban/unban controls in the player roster.
//
// The contract that shapes this file: **the browser never names who gets
// moderated.** Every call sends only the roster's `playerIdentity`; the API
// resolves that against its own record of who has been on this server and builds
// the game's command from it. So there is deliberately no address or name in any
// request here, and nothing in this component should start adding one.
//
// What the game supports comes from the roster response's `moderation` block
// ({ kick, ban, unban, targetKind }) — the backend derives it from the
// blueprint's declared command templates. We render only what it reports, so a
// game with no ban command shows no ban button rather than one that 409s on
// click. `targetKind` names the identity the game addresses (ip | name | id); a
// player who carries no identity of that kind can't be moderated at all, and we
// say so on a disabled control instead of letting the click fail.
//
// Two presentations of the same action set: square icon buttons (`.icon-btn`,
// the panel's ghost row action) on desktop, and a "⋯" menu on phones, where the
// menu keeps both icon AND label. CSS picks which trigger is visible; both drive
// the same `onRun`.
//
// An action the game declares is always RENDERED, and disabled when the moment
// is wrong — a control that vanishes tells the operator nothing, while a
// disabled one that says why is the difference between "this game can't" and
// "not right now". The three gates, broadest first: the server has to be running
// (moderation is a console command — a stopped server has no console, and the
// engine refuses the call outright), the player has to carry an identity of the
// kind the game addresses, and a kick needs them actually connected.

// Which field of a roster row satisfies the game's declared target kind. Mirrors
// the API's own resolution so the control state matches what the call would do —
// this is a pre-emptive courtesy, NOT the authority. The API re-resolves from
// its own record on every request and is free to refuse.
