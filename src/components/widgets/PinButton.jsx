// PinButton — "put this card on my dashboard", on the card itself.
//
// The pin is the primary way a dashboard gets built: you are already looking at the thing you want,
// and the binding comes from where you are standing. The Add-widget catalog is the secondary route,
// and it can only ever offer the widgets that need no binding — nothing in a list can know which
// leaf's journal you meant.
//
// It is a TOGGLE, not an add: filled means this exact target is already on the dashboard, and
// pressing it takes it off. A separate "unpin" living only on the dashboard would mean pressing the
// same control twice does nothing the second time, with no way to tell from here.
//
// ── Two things about where this can be imported ───────────────────────────
//
// It self-suppresses inside a widget. A pinned card offering to pin itself is a dead control, and
// the host already draws its own remove button while arranging. Doing it HERE rather than in each
// card shell is what keeps the shells from having to know widgets exist.
//
// The card shells take the pin as a NODE (`pin={<PinButton …/>}`), not as a descriptor, and that
// is deliberate: `BriefCard` is reachable from the standalone assistant's bundle, and this module
// reaches `persona` through the dashboard store. A `pin={{type, params}}` prop would force
// `BriefCard` to import this, which fails `npm run check:assistant`. The node form keeps the shells
// pure and the panel-only dependency at the call site, where it belongs.

  // skip them cannot be interleaved, and this is a scan of a handful of descriptors.
