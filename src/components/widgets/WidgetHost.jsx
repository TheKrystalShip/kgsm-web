// WidgetHost — everything a pinned card should NOT have to own.
//
// A widget is the same component its page renders, and the point of that is that it stays a
// component: it gets its params and renders. Authorization, a missing target, a crash, the lazy
// boundary, the header, the drag grip and the resize handles are this wrapper's, once, rather than
// each of a hundred cards'.
//
// Four outcomes, and they are deliberately different from one another because they send a person
// somewhere different:
//   • gone       — the widget's type is not in this build. The layout outlived a rename.
//   • forbidden  — the role may not see it. Renders NOTHING and stays in the layout (see below).
//   • stale      — bound to something that no longer exists, or never fully bound.
//   • ready      — mount it.

// ---- WidgetContext -------------------------------------------------------
//
// CANON: A COMPONENT DOES NOT BRANCH ON WHERE IT IS MOUNTED.
//
// A card renders and behaves identically on its own page and pinned to the dashboard. Its data is a
// function of its PARAMS — which server, which leaf — and never of its placement: a store is keyed
// by the target, not by the surface reading it, and a component that took a different path as a
// widget would be two components to keep in agreement, diverging the first time one was touched.
//
// So this context exists for the WIDGET SYSTEM'S OWN chrome and nothing else. The one legitimate
// reader is `PinButton`, which suppresses itself inside a widget because a pinned card offering to
// pin itself again is a dead control — that is the pin, not the card. If you find yourself reaching
// for this to make a card look or load differently as a widget, the answer is somewhere else: the
// host draws no chrome of its own outside edit mode, and the grid already blocks pointer events into
// a widget's body while it is being arranged.
const WidgetContext = React.createContext(null);
function useWidgetContext() { return React.useContext(WidgetContext); }
function useIsWidget() { return React.useContext(WidgetContext) != null; }

// ---- Authorization -------------------------------------------------------
// "Aggregate for reach, scoped for action" (persona.js) applies here as everywhere: a widget about
// ONE node asks whether the role holds the capability ON that node, not anywhere. An admin on
// hotrod and a viewer on node-b must not see node-b's journal because hotrod made them an admin
// somewhere.

    return srv && srv.hostId ? can(entry.cap) : can(entry.cap);
  }
  return can(entry.cap);
}

// Does the thing this widget names still exist?
//
// Distinct from `paramsComplete`, which asks only whether the descriptor has the right SHAPE. This
// asks the live roster, and it is the host's job rather than the component's: a card renders the
// same wherever it is mounted and has no idea it is a widget, so it cannot offer to remove itself
// from a dashboard. It reports "gone" in its own words; the affordance to act on that is here.
//
// `null` means "cannot say yet" — before the roster lands, absent is UNKNOWN, and claiming a server
// was deleted on every cold load would be worse than waiting a beat.
