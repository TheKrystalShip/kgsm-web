// Breadcrumb — a projection of the resolved route + the policy. The root
// "Home" crumb appears only when the persona can reach the dashboard.
//
// This is the ONE breadcrumb: it is rendered by the shell above every page, so a page that draws its
// own would sit under a second trail rather than replace it. A page that goes deeper adds its crumbs
// here instead.
//
// A crumb carries the route it opens, not just a kind, so a trail can step through a parameterised
// place (a node, then that node's Services tab) — which is what makes it able to mirror a nested URL
// rather than approximate it.
//
// The trail follows the URL segment for segment, sub-tabs included: #/cluster/member/hotrod/services
// reads "Home / Cluster / Hotrod / Services", and every crumb but the last opens the prefix of the
// URL it sits at. A tab crumb appears only for a tab the URL actually names — a route's default tab
// is omitted from the hash and so has no crumb, and a stale or mistyped segment (which the page
// resolves back to its default) is left off rather than announced.
//
// One segment is deliberately silent: the `member` word that names a member. It is a namespace
// rather than a place — there is nothing at #/cluster/member — and today the list of members IS the
// Cluster page, so a crumb there would repeat the link beside it. It earns one the day
// #/cluster/members becomes a page of its own.
