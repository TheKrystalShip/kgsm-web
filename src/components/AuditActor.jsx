// AuditActor — the avatar circle for an audit event's actor. Three cases, in this order:
//
//   a KGSM leaf acting on its own  → the SAME icon the Services board gives that leaf, so one
//                                    glyph means one service on every surface
//   any other autonomous action    → the generic system cog
//   a person                       → an AccountAvatar
//
// The leaf case is checked first because it is the specific one: the generic cog would otherwise
// swallow every named service into one anonymous glyph, and it is `bot` — a leaf in its own right —
// that reads worst when it cannot be told apart from "the system did it".

// leafActorId — the leaf behind an actor, or null. An autonomous actor's `name` IS the leaf id
// (kgsm-api parses `system:watchdog` into `{kind:"system", name:"watchdog"}`), so membership of the
// leaf vocabulary is the whole test. A `discord` provider is excluded up front: that name belongs to
// a real person, and a human who happens to be called "monitor" must never be drawn as the metrics
// leaf. The actor's KIND is deliberately not part of the test — an engine row whose actor carries no
// provider prefix parses to `kind:"user"`/`provider:"system"` (kgsm's OS-user fallback), which is
// what a leaf that stamps a bare name looks like by the time it reaches here.
