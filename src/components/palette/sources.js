// palette/sources.js — everything the command palette can reach, as one flat list of entries.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP: the palette never invents a code path. A lifecycle verb here
// runs `runServerAction` and is gated by `verbGuard` — the same two the button on a server card
// uses — so a verb refused on the card is refused here in the same sentence, an optimistic update
// rolls back the same way, and the audit row is written from the same place. The palette is a second
// DOOR onto capability that already exists, never a second implementation of it.
//
// It is also what keeps the thing cheap: every source below is a store the SPA already holds and
// every gate is one that already exists. Nothing here fetches.
//
// Permission is applied HERE, not at render. An entry a role may not act on is never built, so it
// cannot be matched, ranked, arrowed onto or run. "Aggregate for reach, scoped for action"
// (persona.js) applies as everywhere: navigation asks `can`, anything touching one node asks
// `canOn`.

// What a server is CALLED, for anything a person reads. The id stays the value every entry runs
// against — `run` navigates and acts on `s.id`, always — because a label decorates and does not
// identify, and two servers are allowed to share one.
