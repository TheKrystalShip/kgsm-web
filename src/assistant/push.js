// The standalone assistant's Web Push: registering THIS browser with the leaf it is served by.
//
// The leaf announces one thing — an action it staged and is waiting on you to approve — and it does
// so only once you have stopped looking at the chat. Everything else a KGSM host might tell you
// about is the Control Panel's, on its own origin with its own key.
//
// Same-origin throughout: this SPA is served by the leaf that answers `/push/*`, so there is no CORS
// here and no second host to scope a call to. That is the whole reason this surface is the one that
// carries it — the panel's dock talks to the leaf cross-origin, and its own worker is already
// subscribed to kgsm-api's key, which a subscription cannot be shared with.

// ⚠ SELF, not the origin. The id is a key into the session store — `setOriginResolver` is what turns
// it into an address — so any other value resolves to the right URL carrying no bearer, and the 401
// that follows is indistinguishable from the leaf being down.
