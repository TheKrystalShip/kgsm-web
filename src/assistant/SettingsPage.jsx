// The standalone assistant's settings — the preferences that belong to this surface and this
// device, on a page of their own rather than tucked under the conversation rail.
//
// It is built from the Control Panel's own settings furniture (`SubTabs`, `SettingsSection`,
// `SettingsRow`, `ThemePicker`) so somebody who knows one screen knows this one, and so a change to
// how a settings row looks lands on both. What it does NOT borrow is the panel's page: that one is
// about a KGSM account across a cluster — access per node, sessions, connected identities — and
// none of those questions exist on a surface that talks to one leaf.
//
// Two tabs, in the order the questions get asked: how this looks, and how it gets hold of you.
//
// The tab lives in the URL (`#/settings/notifications`), so Back, Forward, refresh and a shared
// link all land on the right one; `appearance` is the default and is omitted.
