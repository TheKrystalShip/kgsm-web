// The standalone assistant's routing — two screens, so the whole scheme fits here.
//
// The Control Panel's `lib/router.js` is a route vocabulary for a cluster (nodes, servers, tabs,
// severities) resolved through a per-node RBAC policy. This surface has one leaf, one conversation
// and one settings page, so it carries its own bridge rather than importing that one: the panel's
// router would drag its persona and connection model in behind it, which is exactly the edge
// `npm run check:assistant` exists to keep cut.
//
// The URL is the source of truth, in the HASH — the leaf serves this SPA with
// `UseDefaultFiles`/`UseStaticFiles` and no SPA fallback, so a path-shaped `/settings` would 404 on
// a refresh. `#/settings` costs the leaf nothing and survives Back, Forward, refresh and a shared
// link.
//
// The landing tab is omitted from the URL, so the plain `#/settings` the chat's own entry points
// produce is the canonical address of the page as it opens.

const SETTINGS_TABS = ["appearance", "notifications"];
const DEFAULT_TAB = SETTINGS_TABS[0];

// `{ kind: "chat" }` or `{ kind: "settings", tab }`. An unknown word is the chat, and an unknown tab
// is the landing one: a stale or hand-typed URL should land somewhere rather than nowhere.
