// LeafActivity — the last few things a leaf actually did, pulled out of the audit feed the panel
// already holds.
//
// It reuses the shared audit row, so an action reads identically here and on the full audit page.
//
// ── Why the attribution is a per-leaf predicate rather than one field ──────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious implementation — filter on `origin == leafId` — is wrong, and measurably so. The audit's
// two provenance axes describe different things, and which one names a given leaf depends on what that
// leaf's relationship to the action was:
//
//   * `origin` names the SURFACE a person acted through. The bot is "discord", not "bot"; the panel is
//     "ui"; the assistant is "assistant". A leaf only appears here when a human went through it.
//   * `actor.name` names WHO acted, and for an unattended action that is the daemon itself — the
//     watchdog's crash-restarts and the scheduler's timed runs land here, with no origin at all on some
//     of them.
//   * The firewall appears as NEITHER. It is the executor, never the actor: a port opens because the
//     assistant or the panel asked, so those rows carry that origin. What identifies them as the
//     firewall's work is the ACTION, `network.ports.*`.
//
// So each leaf brings its own predicate, measured against the real feed rather than assumed. A leaf with
// no honest predicate — the monitor, which performs no auditable action at all — gets no card, because
// an empty lane would read as "this leaf has been idle" when the truth is "this leaf never appears here".
//
// ── The window ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This filters the audit page the store already holds (the most recent ~200 rows cluster-wide), which is
// why the card says "recent" and shows no total. A leaf that has been quiet while others were busy can
// fall out of that window entirely, so a count here would be a count of what this browser happens to
// have loaded — a number that looks authoritative and isn't. The card links to the full log for the
// real answer.
