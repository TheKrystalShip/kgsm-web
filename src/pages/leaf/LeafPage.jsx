// LeafPage — one leaf on one node, with its own sub-tabs. The shell here is deliberately generic:
// identity header, the tab switcher, System, Logs and Settings are IDENTICAL for every leaf, because
// all of that comes from the services row and the leaf config descriptor the leaf already ships. Only
// the middle differs.
//
// The header carries the leaf's name and its status chip and nothing else. Uptime, memory and pid are
// System's; repeating them above every tab put the same row on the page two and three times over.
//
// The trail above the page is the app's own breadcrumb (`components/Breadcrumb.jsx`), which the shell
// renders for every route — this page names its place there rather than drawing a second one.
//
// Adding a leaf's own tabs is therefore a body, not a page: register it in LEAF_TABS below. A leaf
// with nothing special still gets Overview + System + Logs + Settings and needs no code at all. The
// Commands tab is the one that registers itself — it follows the manifest a leaf ships rather than a
// list of leaves kept here, so it arrives with the file.
//
// Admin-only end to end (persona.ROUTE_CAP.leaf = host.manage): every surface it aggregates — the
// service row, the config, the assistant's conversation review — is Admin-policy in kgsm-api.
