// ReactorOverview — what the event-triggered leaf is watching, what it has made of it, and what it is
// deliberately waiting on.
//
// The reactor is the sibling of the scheduler: that one fires on the clock, this one fires on something
// happening. So the question this page answers is not "what is due" but "is it seeing the host at all,
// and has it concluded anything" — which turns out to be four readings, and only one of them is a count
// of work done.
//
// ── The three states that look alike and are not ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A reactor with nothing to report can be any of: deliberately silent (`enabled:false` — the daemon runs
// and records nothing, which is how you quiet it without stopping the unit), sweeping normally over a
// host that simply hasn't done anything worth judging, or wedged. The leaf reports `enabled` and
// `lastSweepAt` precisely so those come apart here, and the page never collapses them into one calm
// green tile.
//
// ── Every counter is since the reactor's process started ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not since the beginning. A restart resets them, so each one says "since start" in its own sub-line —
// a zero on this page after a deploy is a restart, never evidence of a quiet host. The leaf names the
// fields that way on the wire for the same reason.
//
// ── Nothing here is recomputed ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each rule's mode and suppression window arrive ALREADY RESOLVED: a rule named in two mode lists is
// reported at the safest of them, and a rule carrying no window of its own is reported at the host-wide
// one. Re-deriving either from the settings descriptor would show an authority a rule does not actually
// have, which on a page about what a daemon is permitted to do to your servers is the worst kind of
// wrong.
