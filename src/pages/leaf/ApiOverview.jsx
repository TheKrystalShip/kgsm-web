// ApiOverview — the one leaf whose page is served by the leaf it describes.
//
// Everything else in the Control Panel reaches its subject through this API. This page turns that around
// and asks what the API itself is: which build is answering, which leaves it can currently reach, and
// which other nodes it is federated with. Nothing here is a new measurement — it is the data the API
// already publishes about itself, gathered onto the page where someone would look for it.
//
// The Settings tab for this leaf is inert by design (its descriptor is readOnly — applying a change here
// would mean restarting the process serving the request), which is exactly why the Overview carries more
// than the others: it is the only tab with anything to say.
//
// The two sources degrade independently. Identity is the page; peers are additive, and say so when they
// can't be read rather than rendering an empty list that would read as "this node stands alone".
