// SchedulerOverview — what this host is going to do to itself, and how the last round went.
//
// A maintenance window is one appointment plus an ordered set of tasks, and an instance holds a list of
// them. Windows are independent of each other by construction, so the one place they belong together is
// the one an operator thinks of them in: "what fires next on this box". That merged lane is the reason
// this page exists, because the per-server settings surface can only ever show one instance's list, and
// the leaf's Windows tab is the board a person goes to when they already know which appointment they
// mean. This is the glance.
//
// Every time shown is the leaf's own arithmetic, relayed through the api untouched. This file computes
// no schedule; it sorts and formats what the scheduler already decided. A null next fire on a valid
// window is "not due" and a null last run is "hasn't run in this daemon's lifetime" — two different
// silences, worded differently and never filled in.
