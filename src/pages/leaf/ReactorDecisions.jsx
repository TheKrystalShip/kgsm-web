// ReactorDecisions — what the reactor made of what it saw, and the page the decision to let it act is
// taken on.
//
// This is not a log viewer with extra cards. The reactor's plan gates propose and act mode behind a
// review: nothing moves until a window of decisions has been read against what a person would actually
// have done. Until this page the review existed only as `kgsm-reactor --decisions` on a terminal on the
// host, which made the gate something declared rather than performed.
//
// ── Four readings, and each answers a question about a rule rather than about the host ─────────────
//
//   1. What each rule concluded. The share that did NOT fire is the one to read: a rule mostly
//      suppressed is telling you its window is too wide, one mostly unreadable is telling you it rests
//      on something this host cannot answer — which is a rule that will keep failing quietly once it
//      is allowed to act.
//   2. The busiest rolling hour of FIRED decisions. The figure a host-wide ceiling is either a safety
//      net or a gag against.
//   3. How far apart a rule's repeats about one subject were. What a suppression window is derived
//      from — and where there is no repeat, the honest answer is that the window rests on nothing yet.
//   4. The rules that decided nothing at all. The failure that looks most like success: enabled,
//      listed everywhere, silent forever.
//
// ── Nothing here is computed ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every number arrives from the leaf, which derives them from its ledger with the same code its
// terminal report renders. Re-deriving the busiest hour in the browser from the decisions list would
// be wrong the moment that list is capped — and it IS capped, which is why `total` is on the wire
// beside it.
//
// ── It reports; it does not recommend ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// No window, ceiling or threshold is suggested on this page, because none is suggested on the wire.
// The leaf refuses to propose values on the grounds that arithmetic plus a printed figure reads as an
// answer, and a surface that added its own recommendation would put back exactly what the leaf
// declined to say.
