// ReactorProposals — what this host is offering to do, and what recently became of its offers.
//
// An offer is a rule that fired in propose mode: it found a condition, described what it would do, and
// did nothing. Answering one is the only place in the panel where a person authorises an action that
// nothing asked them for.
//
// ── It borrows the alert card, and the borrowing is the point ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// An offer has the same shape as an alert — a severity, a title, a sentence, a couple of answers — so
// it renders through `.alert-card` and `alert-btn`, and the confirm arms through the same
// `useConfirmAction` every lifecycle verb in the panel uses. One affordance, drawn once.
//
// ── What it does NOT borrow is the mechanism ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An alert card's buttons issue an ordinary command; the gate is re-derived at render and that is the
// whole of it. An offer is the opposite: the action is STAGED, and confirming redeems a handle so the
// leaf re-derives the condition first. A server that came back up overnight answers "no longer
// applicable" instead of being restored over — which is what lets an offer wait a shift rather than
// five minutes.
//
// ── The four endings are four different facts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Confirmed, dismissed, lapsed and no-longer-applicable each say something different about the rule
// that staged them, which is why they are four figures rather than answered-and-not.
//
// ── A handle is the capability ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Anything holding one can ask for the action it names. Nothing here puts one in a link, a title
// attribute or anything else that leaves the page.
