// ClusterAnchorList.jsx — the Anchors card.
//
// A cluster's members are nodes and anchors, and they get separate cards because they are
// separate things. A node runs the engine and game servers, so its row is CPU, memory and a
// live link. An anchor provides ONE capability to the whole cluster and has none of those by
// design — putting it in a card headed "Nodes", beside meters it will never fill, describes
// a node that is failing to report rather than a member doing exactly its job.
//
// The card is absent when there is nothing to say. Most installs are one machine with no
// anchor at all, and an empty card headed "Anchors" invites somebody to go and look for the
// thing that is missing.

// A capability nothing serves. It sits here rather than on the Nodes card because a
// capability is what an anchor holds — and it is the one state this page can report that
// nothing else surfaces: the holder was reaped by the failure timers while the assignment
// survived it, so every member stands by against somebody who will never answer, the
// capability is not served, and nothing errors because from the inside nothing failed.
//
// The member it names is precisely the one that is NOT in the list below, which is why the
// notice has to exist separately from the rows.
