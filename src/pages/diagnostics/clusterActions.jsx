// clusterActions.jsx — the admin controls a member row carries, and the two decisions
// they open: what happens to a member, and who holds a capability.
//
// Both decisions are deliberate acts with no automatic equivalent. Nothing promotes
// itself — an automatic failover during a partition produces two members issuing
// conflicting statements about who may do what — and nothing removes a member on its
// behalf. So this is where a person decides, on either card: nodes and anchors are
// different things to look at and the same thing to manage.
