// DiagJobs.jsx — `QueuedJobs` and `RunningJobs`: what one node is about to do, and what it is doing.
//
// A server's own card answers "what is happening to THIS server". It cannot answer "what is this
// node about to do", which is the question a batch creates: ten servers handed to one node, paced
// two at a time, is half an hour of committed work spread over ten cards that each show a fragment
// of it.
//
// ── Two components, not one card with two lanes ───────────────────────────
//
// Queued and Running are independent facts about a node and are built as independent components:
// each owns its own data, its own card, its own pin and its own widget entry, so either can be put
// on a dashboard, sized and placed without the other. An operator watching a long update wants the
// running card three columns wide and may not want the queue at all.
//
// Nothing is shared but the row vocabulary below (verbs, the batch denominator, the row shell).
// Neither imports the other, and neither renders a layout — the Jobs sub-tab arranges them, and the
// dashboard grid arranges them when they are pinned. That is what makes them composable: a component
// that positions its sibling only works where its sibling is.
//
// Both read the ROSTER (`server.job`, the API's `activeJob`), because that is the only source that
// survives a page load: there is deliberately no `GET /jobs`, so a queue assembled from stream frames
// alone would show an empty node to anyone who arrived after a batch was accepted — an idle node,
// drawn for one that is working. `QueuedJobs` additionally reads the batch store, for the denominator
// in "3rd of 8"; `RunningJobs` needs nothing else, and does not take that dependency for symmetry.
//
// ── Live work only; what happened is the audit log's ──────────────────────
//
// These show what a node holds right now. A settled command is not shown at all: it is an audit row
// — durable, fleet-wide, and readable by somebody who was not looking when it happened, which is
// everything a card fed by one browser's open tab is not.
