// needs because a person edits a cadence, a clock time and a weekday, not a string; and the reading of
// an outcome, which is here so the editor, the fleet board and the summary lane never word one
// differently.

// The order tasks run in, which is a property of what they are: an archive taken after an update
// captures the new build instead of the rollback point. The node writes them back in this order too,
// so composing in it is what lets a draft be compared against what is saved.
