// SettingsPage — YOUR account, and nothing about anybody else's. Tabs in the order somebody actually
// asks the questions: who am I (Profile), how do I get in (Security), where am I signed in (Devices),
// what does the assistant know about me (Memory), how do I get told things (Notifications).
// Appearance lives on Profile.
//
// The subject is what puts a tab here, never which service owns the data — this page is already a
// join across three of them (the node's account store, this browser, and the assistant leaf), held
// together by every one of them being about the person reading it.
//
// Tabbed rather than one long column because the five are genuinely different subjects, and stacked
// as equal cards none of them read as primary — the page became a list of slabs with no hierarchy.
// The tab strip is the same `SubTabs` the server detail, node deep-dive and leaf pages use, so this
// page navigates like the rest of the site rather than inventing a fifth idiom for itself.
//
// The tab lives in the URL (`#/settings/security`), so Back, Forward, refresh and a shared link all
// land where they should. `profile` is the default and is omitted, so the plain `#/settings` the
// sidebar produces is the landing tab's canonical address.
//
// The subject is the person reading it. Administering other people's accounts is
// `accounts/AccountsAdmin.jsx`, wherever the cluster keeps them — the anchor's page when one holds
// them, the node's API leaf when it holds its own. A page about who you are is the wrong place to
// decide what everybody else may do.
//
// Your name and username are shown, not edited. They come from whichever door you signed in
// through: a password sign-in carries the account's own display name, a provider sign-in carries
// that provider's rendering of it, re-read at each login. Neither is a field this panel owns, so
// neither is offered as one — an input that silently persists nowhere is worse than a plain value.

// Shared with the breadcrumb, which names the tab the URL carries (lib/labels.js).

  // once and passed down rather than re-derived.

  // The leaf your chat is currently pointed at — memory lives on that leaf, addressed the same way
  // a turn is, direct to the assistant rather than through kgsm-api's peer relay.
  //
  // Which leaf is not incidental here: this page is one page over a whole cluster, and a memory
  // belongs to one assistant. The card is given the host's NAME so it can say whose memory it is
  // showing, and the count of assistant-capable hosts so it can tell "nobody runs one" apart from
  // "several do and the dock is deliberately holding its target unset until you pick". Opening the
  // chat is how that pick is made; this page never offers a second way to set it.
