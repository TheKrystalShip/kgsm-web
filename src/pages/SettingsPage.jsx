// SettingsPage — YOUR account, and nothing about anybody else's. Four tabs, in the order somebody
// actually asks the questions: who am I (Profile), how do I get in (Security), where am I signed in
// (Devices), how does this look (Appearance).
//
// Tabbed rather than one long column because the four are genuinely different subjects, and stacked
// as equal cards none of them read as primary — the page became a list of slabs with no hierarchy.
// The tab strip is the same `SubTabs` the server detail, node deep-dive and leaf pages use, so this
// page navigates like the rest of the site rather than inventing a fifth idiom for itself.
//
// The tab lives in the URL (`#/settings/security`), so Back, Forward, refresh and a shared link all
// land where they should. `profile` is the default and is omitted, so the plain `#/settings` the
// sidebar produces is the landing tab's canonical address.
//
// The subject is the person reading it. Administering other people's accounts is the API leaf's
// Users tab (`leaf/ApiUsers.jsx`), where kgsm-api's account store is — a page about who you are is
// the wrong place to decide what everybody else may do.
//
// Your name and username are shown, not edited. They come from whichever door you signed in
// through: a password sign-in carries the account's own display name, a provider sign-in carries
// that provider's rendering of it, re-read at each login. Neither is a field this panel owns, so
// neither is offered as one — an input that silently persists nowhere is worse than a plain value.
