// Backups list — one row per snapshot. Rendered through the shared BriefCard
// shell; each entry uses the same .chat-brief__item row style as the dashboard's
// Alerts / Recent activity cards. The tab is offered to whoever may read this server's backups; each
// control inside is asked as the request it sends — taking one, restoring one, deleting or pinning
// one, starting a download — and stays on screen, closed, saying what it needs when it is refused.
//
// The backend (GET /servers/{id}/backups) reports each backup's id as `name`
// plus whatever its manifest recorded — size, creation time, captured version.
// Any of those may be absent (a backup the engine lists but has no manifest
// for), and an absent field is simply not rendered: never a fabricated size or
// age, never a "0 B" standing in for unknown.
//
// A backup also records WHY it was taken and WHETHER retention may delete it.
// The two are separate on the wire and stay separate here: the reason rides the
// subtitle (including when it is unknown), and pinned is a badge on the row plus
// the pin/unpin toggle beside Restore. Pinning is not a delete guard — the trash
// still removes a pinned backup — so the toggle is a plain button with no arming.
//
// Delete is arm-then-fire (the shared useConfirmAction, as the lifecycle buttons
// use): the trash swaps to a check for a few seconds and only the second click
// sends. There is no undo behind it — the snapshot is gone from the host — and
// this is an icon in a dense row next to Restore, so a single misclick must not
// be enough.
//
// Download is a two-step: POST a download-ticket, then send the browser to the
// URL it returns. It cannot be a fetch — the archive is unbounded (several GB
// for an instance whose install is captured), and fetch→blob buffers the whole
// thing in memory before the save dialog appears. The ticket exists precisely so
// a plain navigation, which can carry no Authorization header, still
// authenticates; the browser then streams to disk with its own progress and
// resume. Only a COMPRESSED backup can be downloaded: an uncompressed one is a
// directory tree, not one file, and the backend refuses it — so the button is
// disabled with that reason rather than offering a click that always fails.
// How a backup's `reason` reads. The engine's vocabulary is five words; anything
// else is passed through as-is rather than dropped, so a value added to the
// engine shows up here instead of vanishing.

// The one-line subtitle under a backup's id: age · size · version · why, built
// only from the fields the manifest actually carried. A backup with no manifest
// contributes nothing here and renders as its id alone.
//
// The reason is the one field rendered when it is ABSENT too. Null means the
// manifest records none — a backup taken before the engine wrote one, which
// cannot be identified after the fact — and "reason unknown" is that, stated.
// Leaving it blank would read as an ordinary backup, which is the confusion the
// field exists to remove: a snapshot of a broken server and a routine one are
// not interchangeable. It is only claimed for a backup we have a manifest for;
// one listed with no manifest at all says nothing about anything.
