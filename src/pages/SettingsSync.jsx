// The copy has to be exact about what enabling does, because it is not a merge. The device that
// turns it on becomes the source and **overwrites the others** — which is the only rule that
// converges without asking somebody to reconcile two dashboards by hand, and the only one that would
// be a nasty surprise if the button just said "Sync".
