# src/pages/ — pages & routing

One component per route (and per server/host sub-tab). Pages are the **only**
place that composes `lib/` stores + `components/` into a screen. They are all
**lazy-loaded** by `components/AppRouter.jsx` behind a single `<Suspense>`.

## How routing works (the contract)

The URL hash is the source of truth. The pipeline (see `../lib/router.js` for the
full scheme, and `../hooks/useRouteSync.js` for the sync):

```
location.hash  ──parseHash──▶  route {kind, id?, tab?, hostId?, status?, filter?, serverId?, severity?}
route          ──routeToHash──▶ location.hash        (Back/Forward, deep links, refresh all work)
AppRouter: route.kind ──▶ the matching lazy <Page/>
```

- **`route.kind` is the internal vocabulary; the URL word can differ on purpose**
  — `kind:"attention"` ↔ `#/alerts`, `kind:"chat"` ↔ `#/assistant`
  (`kind:"cluster"` ↔ `#/cluster`; `#/diagnostics` and `#/hosts` are aliases that
  also resolve to it). Keep both sides in sync in `router.js` when you add a route.
- **`persona.resolveRoute()` is the routing chokepoint** (`../lib/persona.js`): a
  forbidden route is remapped to the persona's home *before* it enters state or
  mounts. `App.setRoute` runs every route through it. Don't bypass it.
- Most pages receive **navigation callbacks** from `AppRouter` (`onOpenServer`,
  `onAction`, `onTabChange`, `onAsk`, …) — they don't call `setRoute`
  themselves. They read **domain data straight from the singleton stores** via
  `useStore(...)`, not from props threaded down the shell.
- **A component that can be PINNED reaches the router through `useNav()`**
  (`components/NavContext.jsx`) instead, because a widget on the dashboard has no
  page above it to hand it anything. A card that is rendered both ways takes the
  prop and falls back — `const open = onOpenServer || nav.openServer` — so it works
  on its own page and pinned, with no call site changed. `DashboardPage` takes no
  navigation props at all: every card on it is a widget.
- **CANON: a component does not branch on where it is mounted.** Anything that can be pinned
  renders and behaves identically on its page and on the dashboard. Data is a function of its
  PARAMS, never of its placement — which is why the target-scoped stores are keyed
  (`leafLogsStore.byKey`, `logsStore`/`servicesStore`/`logSourcesStore`.`byHost`) rather than
  holding one slot, and why `useKeyedResource` shares the hold instead of the surface owning it.
- **Lifecycle verbs are `lib/serverActions.js`**, not a callback. `runServerAction`
  owns the optimistic patch, the rollback and the wording, so any surface offering a
  Start button does all three. `App.jsx`'s `handleAction` only resolves WHICH server
  the shell means when a caller names none.

### Adding a page/route

1. Add the `route.kind` ↔ hash mapping to `../lib/router.js` (both `routeToHash`
   and `parseHash`).
2. `const NewPage = React.lazy(() => import("../pages/NewPage.jsx"))` +
   `{route.kind === "new" && <NewPage .../>}` in `AppRouter.jsx`.
3. If it's gated, wire the capability in `../lib/persona.js` so `resolveRoute`
   protects it.

## `FirstRunWelcome.jsx` — the one-time tour

Five cards introducing the composable dashboard: one line of text each over a small animation of the
gesture it describes, drawn from divs so there is nothing to ship and nothing to 404. The dashboard
is composed rather than fixed and nothing on screen says so, which is the whole reason it exists.

**Where it is mounted is the feature.** The shell renders it inside the app frame, past every gate —
`AuthGate`, the pending-approval screen, `AddHostPage`, `ColdStartDown` and `BootLanding` all return
earlier — so it can only meet somebody who is signed in, approved and one render away from the
dashboard. Never mid-login.

Seen-state is `krystal:welcome:v1` in localStorage, and **every way out records it**: Get started,
Skip, the close button and Escape. Re-showing a modal somebody has closed, on every load, teaches
them to close it faster rather than to read it. The key is versioned — bump it to re-show the tour
after the mechanics change, and nobody has the new key.

## `auth/` — the screens in front of the app

`auth/` is not on the router. `components/AuthGate.jsx` renders these instead of the shell,
so they answer to no `route.kind` and no persona: `ClusterPage` (which cluster), `SignInPage`
(one card, two tabs, at the anchor), `ClusterUnavailable` (a cluster that answered and cannot
sign anybody in) and `PendingPage` (signed in, holding nothing).
`AuthChrome.jsx` holds what they share. The domain logic — discovery, the credential calls,
the pending session and the field checks — is `lib/authFlow.js` and `lib/anchor.js`, so these
files are the rendering and nothing else.

**A node is never named here.** An account is the cluster's, so a cluster is the only thing
anybody chooses; the address somebody gives reaches one of its members, and which member is a
routing detail that does not surface. **And the text stays thin**: the anchor's refusals name
the rule they applied, so nothing here keeps a second copy of the rules to stand beside them.

Two rules they encode. **A refusal sits with what it is about**: a wrong password renders
above the username inside the form, while an anchor that cannot be reached renders above the
tabs, because it invalidates every door on the card rather than one of them. And **every
check here is also the anchor's** — the client validates shape so somebody is told while
typing, and the anchor decides.

## Administering accounts — two screens, one question

`leaf/ApiUsers.jsx` answers "who may do what" and `SettingsIdentities.jsx` answers "how do I prove
who I am". Both ask `useAccountHolder()` first, because whose accounts these are is the cluster's
answer rather than either screen's. Held by an anchor, an account is the cluster's: one list, no
host picker, and the member the page is routed to is a routing detail that names nothing. Held by
each node, they are that node's and the node is named — a list that did not name it would imply an
account exists somewhere it does not. `SettingsSessions.jsx` asks it too, for two reasons that both cost a person something. It reads
the sessions from ONE source under an anchor, because every member resolves to the same anchor and
fanning out would fetch the identical list once per member — every device rendered as many times as
the cluster has nodes, each copy tagged with a member that has nothing to do with it. And it labels
recency `last refreshed` rather than `last active`, because an anchor's `lastSeen` is the last time
the session rotated its tokens, at roughly a quarter-hour's granularity: calling that activity would
report a person from a token. A node measures its own requests and means what it says.

Neither screen decides where its calls go; `accountDoor` in `../lib/apiClient.js` does, once.

## The split-page folders — keep the entry thin

Big screens live as folders: the entry file stays thin (state + layout) and the
pieces live beside it.
**Don't fold these into their entry file — grow the folder instead.**

| Entry | Folder | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `ChatPage.jsx` | `../chat/` (shared by both surfaces) | thread/message/parts, evidence cards, context meter, host picker, `chatUtils`/`chatConstants` |
| `DiagnosticsPage.jsx` | `diagnostics/` | `DiagOverview/Resources/Services/Logs`, `DiagJobs` (the node's `JobQueue`), host cards, `LeafConfigModal`, `diagHelpers` (the leaf card itself is `components/LeafCard.jsx`; the placement libraries live on the engine's leaf page — `leaf/KgsmLibraries.jsx`) |
| `PerformanceTab.jsx` | `performance/` | `PerfCards`, `perfHelpers` |
| `ServerSettings.jsx` | `serverSettings/` | `SettingsSections` |
| `DashboardPage.jsx` | `dashboard/` | `catalog.js` (the widget registrations), `widgets/` (the pinnable bodies), `fleetKpis.js` (the fleet KPI figures), `DashFleetStrip`, `AddWidgetSheet`, `DashboardEmpty` |
| `leafConfig/LeafConfigPage.jsx` | `leafConfig/` | `LeafConfigRow`, `LeafConfigReview`, `leafConfigHelpers` |
| `GamePage.jsx` | `library/` | `GameOverview`, `GamePlacement`, `GameBlueprintTab`, `GameServersTab`, `BlueprintFileCard`, `BlueprintHostPicker`, `LibraryCreatePage` |

Rule of thumb: **a page pushing ~400 lines gets its own `pages/<name>/`
folder** rather than another append.

## Server, host & game detail = tabbed pages

`ServerDetailPage.jsx`, `DiagnosticsPage.jsx` (host detail) and `GamePage.jsx`
(a library blueprint) render sub-tabs via `route.tab` (`overview` is the default
and is omitted from the URL). A tab the persona can't reach is left out of the
strip and `safeTab` falls back to overview, so a stale URL never mounts an empty
body — the game page's File tab is operator-only on that basis.

**A tab's id, name and place in the strip come from `ROUTE_TABS` in `../lib/labels.js`**,
because a tab is a URL segment and the breadcrumb above the page names it too. The page
keeps what is its own — the badge counting its alerts, and which tabs this persona is
offered — and decorates the shared row. Add a tab there, not in the page. Every server
tab is backed by a real endpoint: `FileBrowser`, `ServerSettings`,
`PerformanceTab` and `PlayersTab` all render measured data.

**A tab whose backend can't answer says so — it never fills itself in.** A value
the API doesn't provide arrives as `null`/`"unknown"`/`[]` from `../lib/adapters.js`
and renders as "—"; a roster that can't be measured renders its own honest
not-measurable state rather than "0 players". Adding a tab means wiring its
endpoint, not inventing numbers to fill it. (Ecosystem-wide "never fabricate a
metric" invariant — see root `CLAUDE.md` and `../lib/adapters.js`.)
