# src/styles/ — CSS, tokens, and the kit barrel

Plain CSS — **no Tailwind, no CSS-modules.** Three files load in order (from
`../main.jsx`): `tokens.css` → `kit.css` → `consumer.css`. Everything is driven
by ~40 CSS custom properties. The root `../CLAUDE.md` ("Styling & themes") has
the full theming narrative; this is the local map + the one rule that matters.

## The one rule

**A component must never hardcode a color — add or extend a token.** Colors live
in theme scopes in `tokens.css`; a rule references them via `var(--…)`. This is
what makes theme switching (and adding a theme) a data change, not a code hunt.

The same now applies to **radius** and to a surface's **border**: write
`border-radius: var(--r-sm)` and `border: var(--edge)`, never a literal, because
those two tokens are how a theme re-shapes the whole app at once.

**`npm run check:tokens` is the guard.** It fails on any `var(--…)` naming a
property nothing defines — the failure mode CSS gives you for free otherwise, in
which `border-color: var(--typo)` silently becomes `currentColor` and
`border-radius: var(--typo)` silently becomes `0`. Two whole families of that had
shipped here before the check existed. It cannot catch a raw literal, though: a
`border-radius: 4px` is valid CSS that simply will not follow a theme.

## `tokens.css` — the design-token source of truth

- Plain `:root` holds **structural** tokens (type, spacing, radius, edge, shadow,
  motion, layout). Most are invariant; a **closed subset** is re-valuable by a
  theme — see "Themes change shape too" below.
- **Color** tokens live in theme scopes: `:root, [data-theme="dark"]` (default —
  applies with no attribute) and `[data-theme="light"]`. Plus overlay tokens
  (`--veil-1/2/3`, `--scrim-base`, `--scrollbar-*`). **A theme = the FULL color
  set re-valued.**
- Adding a theme: add a `[data-theme="x"]` block here, then one `{ id, label }`
  entry in `../lib/theme.js`'s `THEME_OPTS` (`VALID` derives from it and every
  picker reads it), and the concrete-theme list in the `index.html` /
  `assistant.html` boot scripts, which cannot import.

## The colour-vision pack (`cvd-*`) is checked, not eyeballed

Twelve of the themes here are built for viewers who cannot rely on hue, and they
carry a **measured guarantee**: every pair of status colours stays a stated
ΔE2000 apart, and every contrast floor holds, *under a simulation of the
deficiency the theme names*. The pack's banner comment in `tokens.css` states
the exact floors.

**Touching a `cvd-*` token means re-running the check** —
`node /home/heisen/tks/scripts/cvd-check/verify.mjs` — which parses these blocks
back out of this file and re-measures them. A palette here is a solved artefact,
not a preference: "that green looks nicer" is how a theme silently stops being
the thing it claims. That directory also holds the solver that produced the
palettes and a contact-sheet renderer; its `README.md` covers adding one.

The rest follows the same rules as any other theme: a `cvd-*` block is the FULL
colour set, and `THEME_OPTS` carries the `cvd:` field that puts it in the
picker's own badged section.

## Two kinds of palette live here, and they answer to different rules

**A theme named after an upstream scheme ships that scheme's values, unretouched.**
Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, One Dark, Solarized, Catppuccin, Ayu, Monokai, GitHub —
all of them. Several are deliberately low-contrast (Solarized most of all: its
accents are tuned to sit at equal weight against *both* of its backgrounds, and
Nord's `#bf616a` red is 2.5:1 on its own card). Raising them would be raising them
off the thing that makes them recognisable, so **don't "fix" one**: measured
against WCAG floors the eighteen upstream palettes here carry well over a hundred
misses between them, and that is the house position, not an oversight.

**A palette this repo invents is measured.** The colour-vision pack and the
tribute pack are both ours, so both hold: text at 4.5:1 on every surface it lands
on, fills at 3:1, each `-fg` at 4.5:1 over its own `-bg` tint. The one relaxation
is `--fg-4` — placeholder and disabled rank, which the default `dark` theme itself
ships at 2.4:1.

## The tribute pack is quoted, not designed

Eight themes — matrix, win95, winamp, lcars, cyberpunk, dos-blue, c64, pico8 —
take their colours from a screen somebody already knows, and the pack's banner
comment says what that costs. A source palette rarely carries five status
families: CGA has no orange, LCARS has no green, the VGA sixteen were drawn for a
black text mode and sit under 3:1 on a silver face, and most of the VIC-II is
unreadable against its own screen blue. Each block resolves that the same way —
the nearest colour from the SAME source, raised along its own hue where the floor
demands it, with the deviation named in the comment.

**Don't tidy a tribute's ramp with a colour the source never had.** That is the
edit that turns a quotation into just another dark theme, and it is invisible in
review because the result looks better. Contrast was measured on the surfaces each
value actually lands on, including each `-fg` on its own `-bg` tint, so a
retune means re-measuring rather than eyeballing.

## Themes change shape too — but only the tributes, and only these tokens

A theme may re-value a **closed set** of structural tokens: the radius ladder
(`--r-sm/md/lg/xl` and `--r-pill`), the border shorthands (`--edge*`), elevation
(`--shadow-*`), focus (`--ring-*`), `--font-ui`, and the motion tokens
(`--d-*`, `--ease-*`). The exact list is in the structural banner in `tokens.css`;
it is closed on purpose. **The type scale, the 4px spacing scale, `--font-mono`
and the layout metrics are not on it** — a theme changes how the furniture is
shaped, never where it stands, because a palette should not be able to break a
page's layout.

**Only the tribute pack uses it.** An upstream editor scheme re-values colour and
nothing else: Nord and Solarized were syntax palettes and never had an opinion
about a corner or a button. A tribute is quoting a whole *interface*, so shape is
part of the quotation — Win95, DOS Blue and the C64 set every duration to `0ms`
because nothing on those screens eased, and LCARS triples the radius ladder
because the elbow is the entire design language, not decoration on top of it.

Theme blocks are emitted after the structural block and match at equal
specificity, so a re-value in a theme block wins on source order — no `!important`
and no extra selector weight needed.

Two limits worth knowing before you extend this. A true Win95 **bevel** needs four
different edge colours and the `border` shorthand cannot carry them, so that theme
ships the honest half — a 2px flat edge — rather than a fake of the whole; doing it
properly means a shared button/card primitive, which does not exist yet (buttons
are per-domain classes across ~20 partials). And **Monaco cannot read CSS custom
properties**: `CodeEditor.jsx` samples resolved colours at runtime, so the editor
follows a theme's palette but keeps the house geometry and font.

## `kit.css` is a BARREL — do not edit it, edit the partial

The old ~6,300-line monolith was split into focused partials under `kit/`.
`kit.css` **only `@import`s them** — adding rules to `kit.css` itself defeats the
split. Add a rule to the partial that owns the domain:

`base` · `shell` · `page` · `server` · `catalog` · `modal` · `onboarding` · `dashboard`
· `observability` · `controls` · `responsive` · `chat` · `rail` · `toast` · `settings`
· `dock` · `hosts` · `states` · `extras`

`page` is the odd one and is deliberate: the page **heading** (`.dash-head`) and the
in-page **tab strip** (`.subtabs`) are furniture every screen is built from rather
than anything a screen is about, so they sit in their own partial. That is what lets
the standalone assistant carry a settings page — it imports `page` + `settings`
without also importing the partials that style servers and dashboards.

- **Import order is load-bearing** (later wins on equal specificity) — keep the
  `@import` sequence. A new domain gets a **new partial appended to the barrel**,
  never a re-grown monolith.
- `@import` must precede other rules; the imports-only barrel satisfies that.

`consumer.css` — a few consumer surfaces (connect / MOTD / login persona).

## Two barrels over ONE set of partials

`kit.css` is the Control Panel's list; `assistant.css` is the standalone assistant's, and lists only
the partials a chat uses (it has none of the pages the others style). **The partial files are shared
and unedited** — only the lists differ — so the two surfaces are identical by construction and a
change to `chat.css` or a token lands in both. Never copy a rule between them; a copy is the drift
this arrangement exists to prevent.

A subset is the one thing that can silently go wrong: a widget whose rules live in a partial that was
left out renders unstyled and nothing fails. `npm run check:assistant` checks every class the
standalone surface can render against the CSS it ships, so add the missing **partial** when it
complains.

## Theme landmines (see root `../CLAUDE.md` for detail)

- **No-flash:** an inline boot script in `index.html` sets `data-theme` before the
  stylesheet applies — it mirrors `../lib/theme.js`; keep the two in sync.
- **Always-dark media surfaces** (cinematic hero over key-art) pin dark tokens
  **locally** (see `.hero--cinematic` in `kit/server.css`) rather than
  per-theme special-casing.
- jsdom smoke does **not** lay out CSS — test theme/layout with the visual harness
  (`/home/heisen/tks/scripts/visual-harness/`, `--theme dark|light`).
