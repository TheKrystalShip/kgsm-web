// RecentConversations — the fresh-chat screen's "pick up where you left off" card.
//
// The conversation list is already this surface's own state (hydrated from localStorage, merged
// with what the leaf holds), so this renders it rather than fetching anything: the card is a second
// view of the rail, placed where a person who has just opened a new chat is actually looking. It is
// a plain child of the empty state rather than an injected panel, which is what gives the Control
// Panel and the standalone assistant the same card from one place — it reaches only the shared
// BriefCard shell, so nothing here can pull the panel's data layer into the standalone bundle
// (scripts/check-assistant-bundle.mjs).
//
// The row markup is the alerts card's `.chat-brief__item` family verbatim. Two lists that read
// differently on the same screen would look like two features; sharing the classes means a change
// to the card family lands on both at once.

// When a conversation was last touched. The leaf's `lastActivityAt` when it has said, the creation
// time otherwise — never now(), which would sort every unknown conversation to the top and read as
// a timestamp this surface does not have.
