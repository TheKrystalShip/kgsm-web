// spokenReply.js — plays an answer the assistant is reading aloud, one sentence at a time.
//
// The leaf emits `audio.delta` frames INTERLEAVED with the text: each sentence is synthesised the
// moment it is written, so the first arrives while the model is still writing the third. This queues
// them and plays them back to back, which is the whole job — a sentence that waited for the previous
// one to finish is a sentence that arrives on time, and one played the instant it lands talks over
// the answer.
//
// ⚠ AUTOPLAY: a browser refuses audio until the page has been interacted with, and an AudioContext
// created before that starts `suspended`. Sending a message IS an interaction, so the context is
// created and resumed on the send that asked to be spoken — not at import, and not on the frame,
// which arrives seconds later with no gesture behind it.
//
// ⚠ It decodes rather than streams. Each frame is a self-contained file, so there is no decoder state
// between sentences and a dropped one costs exactly itself.

// The one context per surface. Created lazily because constructing one before a gesture is what
// leaves it suspended, and a suspended context that nothing resumes plays silence forever.
