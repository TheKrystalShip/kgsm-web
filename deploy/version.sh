# the binary and the changelog can never disagree about what this is.

# The SPA is an npm project, so its version is package.json's, not a csproj's.

# A pacman pkgver may not contain a hyphen, so --pkgver strips it. That keeps prerelease ordering
# correct under vercmp: 3.16.0rc3 < 3.16.0rc4 < 3.16.0.
