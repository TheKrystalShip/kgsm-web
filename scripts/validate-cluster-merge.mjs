// The connected hosts and the cluster roster are joined by id, exactly.
//
// A node's cluster identity defaults to the same stable id its host card carries — kgsm-api
// resolves Api__NodeId from Api__HostId so a node has no second independent name — so the join
// is `host.id === member.memberId` and nothing has to be guessed.
//
// This exists because the guess was wrong in a way that removed a member from the page: a
// substring test across id/label/address read "hotrod-auth" as "hotrod", so a machine's anchor
// was absorbed into that machine's node row and vanished, taking the node's own federation data
// with it.
//
// Pure module test: no DOM, no server, no network.
