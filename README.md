# Krystal Control Panel (`kgsm-web`)

The web Control Panel SPA for the KGSM ecosystem — a **standard Vite + React 18**
single-page app (JSX). It was ported from the no-build `krystal-design`
prototype (React + Babel from a CDN, every symbol on `window`) into a real,
tree-shaken ES-module build.

> **Runtime multi-host client.** There is ONE data path: the app always talks to
> real `kgsm-api`(s). With no host connected it opens the **"connect a host"**
> screen — you tell it which `kgsm-api`(s) to talk to; the registry lives in
> localStorage. A `VITE_API_BASE` seed can pre-connect one host for dev. Each
> connected host's `kgsm-api` must allow the SPA origin via `KGSM_API_CORS_ORIGINS`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173 — no host connected → the connect screen
npm run build        # → dist/  (minified, hashed, production bundle)
npm run preview      # serve the built dist/ locally
npm run deploy:prod  # build + sync dist/ into the kgsm-api wwwroot — NO API restart
```

## Deploying the frontend (no API restart)

`kgsm-api` serves this SPA same-origin from its `wwwroot/` via ASP.NET's static
file middleware (read from disk per request — no in-memory content cache). So a
**pure frontend change** doesn't need an API restart: `npm run deploy:prod`
(`deploy/deploy.sh`) builds with `VITE_API_BASE=self` and `rsync`s `dist/`
straight into the live `wwwroot/` (`/opt/kgsm-api/wwwroot`, owned by the service
user → no sudo). The new bundle is live the moment the files land. Override the
target with `KGSM_API_WWWROOT=/path`.

Run `./deploy/setup.sh` once on a new host first — it verifies the wwwroot target
exists and is writable by you, and `deploy.sh` refuses until it is. This is the
same `setup.sh`-once / `deploy.sh`-forever pattern every `kgsm-*` repo uses, and
the only one that needs no privilege even at setup: the SPA owns no systemd unit,
so there is nothing to install and no polkit grant to make.

For an **API code change**, use the full `kgsm-api/deploy/deploy.sh` instead — it
publishes the API and re-bundles the SPA, swapping the systemd service.

## Verifying

```bash
npm run build      # the mechanical check — fails on any dangling import
KGSM_API=http://127.0.0.1:8096 npm run smoke   # jsdom mount of the read paths against a RUNNING kgsm-api
```

`npm run smoke` (`scripts/smoke-live.mjs`) boots the real Vite module graph in jsdom
against a running backend and asserts real backend data renders without crashing. It
needs an **auth-disabled** backend (unauthenticated reads + tier=admin from `/me`) — it
sends no bearer, so it refuses an auth-enabled host up front. `scripts/visual-harness/
dev-api.sh` in the workspace root serves one on `:8096`. See `CLAUDE.md` for the rest of
its contract (Monaco is stubbed; probe instances come from the live roster).

## Layout

```

### The data layer (`src/lib/`)

The prototype's reactive store layer, ported verbatim to ESM:

- `store.js` — `createStore` / `useStore` (React 18 `useSyncExternalStore`).
- `apiClient.js` — the backend seam (`api`): `fetch` against `kgsm-api` (REST,
  translated by `adapters.js`) + one WebSocket per host (`liveStream.js`). The
  ONE place that talks to the backend; call sites only see `api`.
- `adapters.js` — the honesty boundary (kgsm-api DTOs → component shapes;
  unsourced values → `null`/`"unknown"`/`[]`, never a fabricated default).
- `config.js` — the connection registry (which `kgsm-api`(s) the app talks to).
- `stores.js` — domain stores (`serversStore`, `hostsStore`, `auditStore`, …),
  each empty until it hydrates from the API.
- `sessionStore.js`, `capabilities.js`, `alertsApi.js`, `merge.js`,
  `persona.js`, `router.js` — sessions/auth, per-host capabilities, alerts,
  multi-host merge, RBAC persona, and hash↔route translation.

> **Init order note.** A few base-layer modules import upper ones only for
> deferred, call-time use; those edges are `import(...)`-lazy to keep the ESM
> graph acyclic. See the comments in `apiClient.js`.

## Connecting the backend

The normal path is **in-app**: run `npm run dev`, and on the connect screen enter a
`kgsm-api` address (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`). The app probes its public
`/api/v1` handshake, registers it (URL only, in localStorage), and boots against it.
Connect more hosts later from the Fleet page — the SPA fans reads out across all of
them and rolls them up (`src/lib/merge.js`).

For dev you can pre-connect one host without the connect screen:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# VITE_API_BASE=http://your-host:8080   (a SEED host — kgsm-api ORIGIN, no /api/v1; the client appends it)
# VITE_WS_BASE is optional (derived from VITE_API_BASE if unset)
```

⚠ each connected host's `kgsm-api` must allow the SPA origin via
`KGSM_API_CORS_ORIGINS`. The seams are `src/lib/apiClient.js`
(`get/post/patch` + `fanOut` + the WebSocket, with adapters in
`src/lib/adapters.js`) and `src/lib/connect.js` (the connect probe); call sites
only see `api`. **`WIRING.md` is the authoritative front↔back contract**
(endpoint/realtime/schema diff + the sequenced wiring plan).

## What's done vs. what's left

**Done:** the full UI on a real toolchain — all components + pages, the
store/router/data layer, self-hosted fonts, lucide-react icons, the complete CSS,
a green production build, and the live backend wiring (servers/hosts/audit/library/
alerts via `fetch` + adapters + the realtime WebSocket, with honest-unknown
rendering and the per-host Discord auth gate).

**Done (PWA):** the app is **installable** on Android/desktop Chrome and iOS
Safari — a web app manifest (`public/manifest.webmanifest`) + a minimal
same-origin service worker (`public/sw.js`, registered production-only via
`src/lib/registerSW.js`) that serves an offline app shell while leaving all
live `kgsm-api` traffic untouched. See "PWA / installability" below.

**Left** (see `WIRING.md §8`): backends for the Files / Settings / Performance /
Players sub-tabs (their UI renders a "work in progress" state today), optional
TypeScript, a unit-test runner (Vitest + RTL), and a full Workbox **precache**
(`vite-plugin-pwa`) — the current SW caches the shell on demand, not the whole
build manifest up front.

## PWA / installability

**Both surfaces are Progressive Web Apps.** On Android Chrome each offers **Install app** (Add to
Home Screen) and runs standalone and full-screen; they install as **two separate apps**, since
they are two origins with two manifests. The pieces, per surface:

| | Control Panel | standalone assistant |
|---|---|---|
| entry | `index.html` | `assistant.html` |
| manifest | `public-panel/manifest.webmanifest` | `public-assistant/assistant.webmanifest` |
| worker | `public-panel/sw.js` | `public-assistant/assistant-sw.js` |
| artwork | `public-panel/icons/` + `splash/` | `public-assistant/icons/` + `splash/` |
| served by | kgsm-api | the kgsm-assistant leaf |

`public/` holds only what both share (fonts, brand mark) and Vite copies it into both bundles; each
surface's own half is laid over the top from `public-<surface>/` by `scripts/public-overlay.js`.
Shared-by-default is the point — a new shared asset needs no edit, and only a difference is
declared. `npm run check:assistant` fails the assistant build if its manifest, worker or any icon
it names is missing from `dist-assistant/`.

- **The manifests** carry name/short_name, `start_url`/`scope` `/`, `display: standalone`, the
  `#0B0F14` theme/background and 192/512/maskable icons. Chrome will not offer an install without
  the 192 **and** 512.
- **The artwork is `.chat-empty__logo`**, the badge at the head of an empty conversation, drawn to
  the pixel: `scripts/make-assistant-icons.mjs` renders the lucide `bot` in `--krystal-teal` on
  `--krystal-teal-dim` over `--canvas`, the glyph 26/56 of the frame and its stroke the `1.7` every
  `<Icon>` uses. One drawing serves the favicon (SVG, plus a 32px PNG fallback), the
  `any`/`maskable`/apple-touch icons and the 13 iOS launch images. ⚠ The script cannot read a CSS
  custom property, so those colours and that geometry are **copied** from `styles/tokens.css` and
  `kit/chat.css` — change the element and you must change the script. Run it by hand after changing
  the artwork; it needs `rsvg-convert` and no build invokes it.
- **The two service workers differ in what they may cache, and the difference is load-bearing.**
  The panel's DENIES `/api/` and `/auth/`, which is exhaustive for kgsm-api. The assistant's
  **allowlists**, because the leaf's routes are unprefixed at the root (`/turn`, `/conversations`,
  `/tools`, `/health`) — a denylist there caches every route the leaf grows until someone remembers
  to add it, and a stale authenticated `200` both masks token expiry and serves one person's
  conversation from another's cache. Both are network-first for navigations (a deploy lands on the
  next online load) and cache-first for content-hashed assets; neither sits in a live data path.
- **`src/lib/registerSW.js`** registers a surface's own worker **in production builds only**
  (`import.meta.env.PROD`), after `load`. Dev and the jsdom smoke never register one, so HMR and
  tests are unaffected.
- **Each entry HTML** also carries the iOS install hints (`apple-touch-icon`,
  `apple-mobile-web-app-*`, `apple-touch-startup-image`), since iOS Safari ignores the manifest.

Installability requires **HTTPS** (localhost is exempt). To check a deployed surface the way Chrome
does, `scripts/visual-harness/pwa-check.mjs` reads the parsed manifest and the worker's state out
of a real headless Chromium, and `sw-cache-check.mjs` beside it asserts the assistant's worker
leaves the leaf's API uncached. Locally: `npm run build && npm run preview`, then DevTools →
Application → Manifest / Service Workers.
