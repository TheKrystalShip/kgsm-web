# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Auto-backup rows in Scheduled tasks card: "Back up before restart" toggle and
  "Keep N backups" retention input (shown only when a restart cadence is set).
  "Last backup" read-only row shows most-recent backup timestamp and status from
  the scheduler socket.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Scheduled restart card** in server Settings. Cadence (off/daily/weekly/6h), time,
  day-of-week (weekly only), optional timezone override, and next-scheduled-restart
  timestamp from the kgsm-scheduler leaf. Scheduler-gated — gracefully absent when
  the leaf is not deployed.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Settings Phase 2 — Resources.** CPU priority (Low/Normal/High) and Memory cap (MiB, 0=uncapped)
  rows are now live in the Settings tab, watchdog-gated. CPU priority is live-applied to the running
  cgroup; memory cap persists to config and takes effect at next restart (noted in the sub-label).
  Both show the current values from the API on load.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Settings Phase 1 — Autostart.** The Startup & recovery section is now live: shows an Autostart
  toggle when the watchdog capability is healthy (Save/Reset wire through). When watchdog is offline,
  shows an honest "Watchdog offline — autostart unavailable" message instead of the Phase 1 placeholder.
  The "—" sentinel appears when the watchdog is provisioned but the GET couldn't read the value.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Settings tab wired (Phase 0).** `ServerSettings.jsx` is now live: loads settings from
  `GET /servers/{id}/settings`, auto-update toggle is wired end-to-end, Save and Reset buttons
  call `PATCH /servers/{id}/settings`, Delete button calls `DELETE /servers/{id}` with a
  two-step confirmation and navigates to the server list on 202 acceptance. Startup & recovery,
  Scheduled tasks, and Resources sections show honest "Available in Phase N" placeholders until
  their primitives land. `fetchSettings`, `patchSettings`, and `deleteServer` added to `stores.js`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- **Realtime transport migrated from WebSocket to fetch-based SSE.** `GET /api/v1/stream`
  is now `text/event-stream` (topics chosen via `?topics=`, bearer sent as an `Authorization`
  header instead of `?access_token=`). Fixes the class of WS-401 incidents caused by a
  browser being unable to set headers on a WS handshake and an opaque `1006` close on
  auth failure — SSE surfaces a readable `401` that heals through the same reactive
  rotate-on-401 path as every REST call. One persistent **primary** stream per host
  (global topics, drives `realtimeStore` mode + `rehydrateAll`) plus ref-counted
  **dynamic** per-topic streams for resource-scoped views. Dropped all client-side token
  expiry prediction (`tokenExpMs`/`tokenExpired`/`wsBearer`); the Dashboard Ping KPI is
  now REST-timed (`GET /health` RTT) instead of a WS ping/pong.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Player roster desktop layout**: Status, First seen, and Last seen columns no longer
  shrink excessively on wider screens. Added minimum column widths (`110px`/`120px`) to
  prevent squishing while preserving the mobile layout.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Unified permanent player roster view**: `GET /servers/{id}/players` now returns the
  full history roster (every player who has ever connected, with status, first seen, last seen).
  Status indicator with colored dot + text label. Mobile responsive: time columns hidden on
  small screens, status label visible.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Players tab wired to the frozen player-presence contract** (`player-presence-contract.md`
  §5): `GET /servers/{id}/players` hydrates the roster, then the `players` WS topic
  (`players.join`/`players.leave`, keyed by `sessionKey`) follows live joins/leaves —
  tail-then-follow, same ordering guarantee as the Console tab. Replaces the old
  prototype scaffold (ping/playtime/online-banned-allowlist status/kick-ban actions —
  none of which the backend can honestly source) with a thin, honest roster: a row's
  label falls back name → addr → sessionKey (never blank), and `detection:"unknown"`
  renders an explicit "presence not available for this game" — never a fabricated
  "0 players online".
- **`players.reset` handling**: the api clears its own roster on an instance
  stop/start/restart (a killed process emits no `players.leave` lines), so a
  `{type:"players.reset", data:{serverId}}` frame tells an already-open tab to drop
  its stale rows too — no REST refetch needed, a rejoin flows back in as an
  ordinary `players.join`. Prevents phantom "connected" rows surviving a restart.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- **Session handling rewritten to a reactive model — the API is the authority.**
  The client no longer predicts access-token expiry. It uses whatever token it
  holds and rotates only when told to: an HTTP `401` response rotates the refresh
  token and replays the call once (`hostScoped.withRetry`), and that is the entire
  REST freshness story. Removed the proactive-refresh `setTimeout`, the
  `EXPIRY_SKEW_MS` margin, the separately-tracked shadow `exp`/`capExp` fields, and
  the `visibilitychange` pre-freshen — every WebSocket 401 bug we've had came from
  one of those trying to *predict* expiry and drifting out of sync with the real
  token. `sessionStore` collapses to `token()` / `rotate()` / `authorize()`.
- **WebSocket auth:** because a browser hides a WS-handshake `401` as an opaque
  `1006` close, the socket can't heal reactively like REST. It (and only it) reads
  the access token's own JWT `exp` claim right before dialing (`tokenExpired`) and
  rotates a lapsed token first, so it never opens a connection the API would reject.
  This subsumes the v0.2.1 stop-gap.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Realtime WebSocket 401-loop after a token lapses (e.g. a tab left open overnight,
  then refreshed). The session freshness gate keyed off a client-tracked `exp` field
  that could drift ahead of — or be missing from — the access token's real expiry,
  so a dead token read back as `live`, the funnel handed it to the socket, and it
  401-looped forever without ever attempting a refresh. The token's own JWT `exp`
  claim (exactly what the API validates) is now authoritative in the freshness gate,
  the persisted-session read, and the proactive-refresh timing; the stored `exp` is
  demoted to a faithful cache of that claim (written from the token, never computed
  independently). Auth-disabled hosts and non-JWT bearers are unaffected.

### Added
- Metrics-threshold alerts: the alert feed now surfaces the new kgsm-api `metrics`
  (per-server) and `host-monitor` (host-scope) sources alongside `watchdog` crashes —
  same page, dashboard, sidebar badge, and filters, no new surface. Host-scope alerts
  (no `serverId`, `anchor.surface: "host"`) render cleanly and get an **Open host**
  click-through to the host page; per-server metric alerts deep-link to that server's
  Performance tab. Source→icon already covered `metrics` (gauge) / `host-monitor`
  (server); this wires the navigation for the null-serverId host case.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Realtime WebSocket no longer 401s on every fresh page load. The first `/stream`
  dial runs during `apiClient` module eval, before the lazy `sessionStore` import
  resolves, so the egress auth funnel fell through to a tokenless connect → a
  guaranteed 401, healed only by the ~2.5s reconnect backoff. `authorizedBearer`
  now awaits the session-module-ready promise, so the first dial already carries
  the access token (restored synchronously from `sessionStorage` on an in-tab
  reload — no extra round-trip).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Initial versioned release.
