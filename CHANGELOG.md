## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Realtime WebSocket no longer 401s on every fresh page load. The first `/stream`
  dial runs during `apiClient` module eval, before the lazy `sessionStore` import
  resolves, so the egress auth funnel fell through to a tokenless connect → a
  guaranteed 401, healed only by the ~2.5s reconnect backoff. `authorizedBearer`
  now awaits the session-module-ready promise, so the first dial already carries
  the access token (restored synchronously from `sessionStorage` on an in-tab
  reload — no extra round-trip).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Initial versioned release.
