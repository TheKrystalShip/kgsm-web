# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

`kgsm-web` builds the KGSM ecosystem's **web surfaces**: the **Control Panel** and the
**standalone assistant** served by the kgsm-assistant leaf. Two Vite builds over one source tree,
sharing `src/chat/` — the conversation is the same code in both, because a divergence between the
dock and the standalone page would be a bug, not a variant. Everything that differs is a prop.
The standalone surface must not reach the panel's data layer; `npm run check:assistant` enforces
it (see `src/CLAUDE.md`). The Control Panel is a standard
Vite + React 18 (JSX) single-page app. It is a **runtime multi-host client**: it reads a localStorage
registry of `kgsm-api` hosts and talks to them over `fetch` + SSE. The
`README.md` covers quick-start and the file layout; this file covers the
architecture and the landmines.

**Per-directory docs (read the one for wherever you're working):** the source
tree carries focused nested `CLAUDE.md` files with each area's structure and
local conventions — `src/CLAUDE.md` (the source map +
module boundaries), `src/pages/CLAUDE.md` (pages & routing), `src/lib/CLAUDE.md`
(data layer), `src/lib/stores/CLAUDE.md` (the domain-split stores),
`src/components/CLAUDE.md` (shared UI + `<Modal>`), `src/styles/CLAUDE.md` (CSS
tokens + the `kit/` barrel). This file stays the architecture/landmines narrative.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173 — no host configured → the connect screen
npm run build        # → dist/  (minified, hashed, tree-shaken)
npm run dev:assistant     # http://localhost:5174 — the STANDALONE assistant surface
npm run build:assistant   # → dist-assistant/
npm run check:assistant   # the standalone bundle contains no Control Panel, and is fully styled
npm run deploy:assistant  # = deploy/deploy-assistant.sh — publish it into the leaf's wwwroot
npm run preview      # serve the built dist/
./deploy/setup.sh    # ONCE per host — creates the web root and hands it to you (sudo once)
npm run deploy:prod  # = deploy/deploy.sh — build + rsync dist/ into the web root, nothing restarts

npm run check:entry  # what an address is: anchor, standalone node, or a node inside a cluster
npm run check:door   # where an account call goes — anchor or node — in both clusters
npm run check:origin # a roster address this page cannot fetch never becomes a connection
npm run check:reset  # clearing local data clears all of it, and nothing else on the origin

KGSM_API=http://127.0.0.1:8096 npm run smoke   # against a RUNNING, AUTH-DISABLED kgsm-api
```

`check:door` runs offline, and has to: the smoke's backend is auth-disabled, which reports no
anchor and exercises no account surface at all.

**The panel is served by no node.** It is a static artifact that belongs to no cluster: it holds no
cluster state, depends on no node, and reaches whichever cluster it is pointed at over that
cluster's public addresses. `npm run deploy:prod` (`deploy/deploy.sh`) builds and `rsync`s `dist/`
into the directory a web server publishes (`/srv/kgsm-web`, yours → no sudo; override with
`KGSM_WEB_ROOT`). The bundle is live the moment the files land, because nothing is running to
restart. Which server publishes it — nginx, an object store, a CDN — is a deployment choice this
repo does not make.

The build carries **no node address**. Baking one in would make this that node's panel.

It carries an anchor only when the host has configured one: `KGSM_AUTH_ANCHOR` in the untracked
`deploy/deploy.local.env`, or the environment. **Blank by default, and blank is the interesting
case** — an unconfigured build points at no cluster and asks for an address, which is what lets one
deployment serve any of them. Configured, it opens on that cluster's sign-in instead. Either way it
is a DEFAULT and never a lock: a door somebody has already chosen wins, "Another address" still
reaches the address box, and the value is classified like any other address rather than trusted.

This repo follows the same `setup.sh`-once / `deploy.sh`-forever pattern every
`kgsm-*` repo uses. It owns no systemd unit and runs no process of its own, so
`setup.sh` installs nothing and needs no polkit grant: it creates the web root and hands it to you,
which is the one thing that needs privilege and the reason it asks for sudo once. It verifies the
target is writable the way `deploy.sh` will use it, since a mode bit is not a
guarantee. `deploy.sh` then builds and `rsync`s with **no sudo and no prompts**, and
refuses up front with *"run `deploy/setup.sh`"* when the target isn't there. The
three files in `deploy/` are self-contained, so a standalone clone deploys.

**There is an ESLint gate (`npm run lint`) but no typecheck or unit-test runner** —
don't hunt for `npm run test`. The lint config (`eslint.config.js`, ESLint 9 flat)
is deliberately NARROW: `no-undef` and `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` are **errors**
(these are static bug classes the build itself cannot catch — a component
used-but-not-imported, a hook called after an early return);
`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` and `no-unused-vars` are **warnings** (a real backlog
to work down, not a wall). Keep errors at zero. The other automated check is
`scripts/smoke-live.mjs` (`npm run smoke`): it boots the real Vite module graph in jsdom
against a RUNNING kgsm-api and asserts real backend data renders without crashing. After any
data-layer or route change, run `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run build` (no
import dangles), and `npm run smoke` against a live api.

Five things about the smoke are load-bearing enough to state outright:

- **It never mutates the host.** Every assertion is either a READ against the live backend or a
  WRITE INTERCEPTED at the fetch seam (assert the request the SPA builds, answer it synthetically).
  This is not fastidiousness: kgsm's event transport is a single host-wide journal
  (`/var/lib/kgsm/events/*.ndjson`) indexed by ONE kgsm-monitor, and **every** kgsm-api on the box —
  including the operator's `:8097` — merges its engine history from that one monitor. There is no
  such thing as a write scoped to the backend under test; anything reaching the engine lands in the
  operator's real audit log permanently and rides the live consumer out to their notification
  integrations. So: no `kgsm.sh events emit`, no engine-touching PUT/DELETE, and nothing requiring
  this process to sit next to the engine. A run leaves nothing behind because it writes nothing —
  not because it cleans up afterwards. Coverage this gives up (the journal→api→stream relay, the
  note's verbatim round trip through a SOURCED config) lives in kgsm-api's `AuditJournalRelayTests`
  / `ServerNoteRoundTripTests`, which own a disposable fixture.
- **It needs an AUTH-DISABLED backend.** It sends no bearer, so a real auth-enabled host
  401s every gated read. The backend it expects is
  `/home/heisen/tks/scripts/visual-harness/dev-api.sh` (`:8096`) — the harness lives at the
  workspace root, outside every repo, so it is named absolutely and runs from whichever repo is
  being worked in. The prod unit on `:8097` has auth ON, and the smoke refuses it up front with a
  message rather than degrading into a wall of failures. Run it as
  `KGSM_API=http://127.0.0.1:8096 npm run smoke`.
- **The backend URL is written to `.env.development.local`, not `.env.local`.** The vite
  server boots in "development" mode, and Vite ranks a mode-specific env file above a plain
  one — the committed `.env.development` (seeding `:8090`) beats `.env.local`, so writing
  there silently does nothing and the whole suite runs against the wrong port.
- **Monaco is stubbed with a `textarea`.** It is built for a real browser and throws from
  inside its own mount under jsdom, which surfaces as the *page* hitting its error boundary
  — every surface hosting it (blueprint editor, create page, file editor, chat draft) would
  be untestable. Its real behaviour is proven in Chromium by the visual harness; the smoke
  asserts the wiring around it.
- **Instances are DERIVED from the live roster, never named.** `PROBE`/`OTHER` come from
  `GET /servers`, because a hardcoded instance name rots the moment someone uninstalls it
  and then fails in a way that reads like an SPA regression.

**Every visual change is checked in the harness before it ships.** Not "may be" — the offline suites
cannot see any of it. `smoke` runs in jsdom, which lays out no CSS, has no origin policy and mounts
past every gate: a preflight the browser refuses, a sign-in card that never renders, a credential
posted to a path that does not exist and a shell that never resolves have all shipped green. If a
change alters what a person sees or what the browser does on their behalf, a run here is the only
thing that can tell you it works.

**The harness is `/home/heisen/tks/scripts/visual-harness/`** — its own git repository, beside the
`kgsm-*` checkouts rather than inside one, because it tests this panel but stands up kgsm-api and
kgsm-auth to test it against. Commit a script you add there, in that repo. Its `.state*/` never is:
those hold a session signing key, account stores with password hashes and the bootstrap passwords a
test signs in with.

There is a script per thing worth seeing, and adding one is the normal way to check a change — copy
the nearest neighbour, since they all share `_panel.mjs`. Existing ones worth knowing: `shoot.mjs`
(screenshots + overflow/footer diagnostics for any route), `auth-routes.mjs` (the address bar and
real history), `cors-anchor.mjs` (what the live anchor accepts, from the panel's own origin),
`standalone-signin.mjs` (signing in at a node that holds its own accounts, `API_AUTH=on`),
`cluster-signin.mjs` (signing in at a real anchor and the fleet arriving from it),
`anchor-accounts.mjs` (administering a cluster's accounts on the anchor's page, against a real
anchor and a real clustered node), `standalone-accounts.mjs` (the mirror: a node holding its own,
and the tab leaving when a member takes them), `anchor-config.mjs` (configuring an anchor on its own
page — the run that caught a CORS list with no `PUT` in it), `anchor-tabs.mjs` (an anchor reached at
the member route a node uses, its own tab strip, and the URL and trail following the tab),
`anchor-logs.mjs` (its journal arriving live, through the panel's own console),
`live-panel-anchor.mjs` (the deployed panel, read-only and unauthenticated).
Playwright + **Chromium and Firefox** (no sudo on this host) drive the real SPA against
a real **auth-disabled** dev kgsm-api with real data — this is the only way to actually
*see* a mobile/responsive/overflow bug rather than reason about the CSS. Flow:
background `dev-api.sh` (auth-off api on :8096, state sandboxed) + `dev-web.sh`
(Vite on :5190, seeded — leaves your `:5173` alone), then `node shoot.mjs
'#/servers/factorio-test/files' --device both --click 'manage.sh'` → PNGs in
`shots/` + overflow/footer-overlap diagnostics. See that dir's `README.md` for the
full recipe and gotchas (port waits, teardown, the `pkill -f` self-match trap).

**Chromium alone is not proof.** The engines disagree about real things — most sharply,
a percentage height resolves only against a *definite* containing block, and Chromium
resolves one against a flex-derived height where Firefox follows the spec and collapses
the element. `shoot.mjs --engine both --measure '<css>,<css>'` measures the selectors in
each engine, prints what they disagree about, and **exits 2** when they do. Use it for
anything resting on a percentage height, a flex/grid track, sticky/fixed positioning, or
`100vh`/`dvh`. Firefox contexts take no `isMobile`/`hasTouch`/`deviceScaleFactor`
(Playwright rejects them), so a Firefox "mobile" run is the viewport only — check
touch- and DPR-dependent behaviour in Chromium.

**Monaco's own mounts are the live instance of that trap:** `@monaco-editor/react`
renders a `<section style="height:100%">`, so every editor wrapper must give it a
definite height. `.bp-editor__monaco-wrap` states a grid track (`minmax(0, 1fr)`) for
exactly this reason — the file browser's `flex: 1` works only because `.fb-card` already
fills its modal from a grid. Reach for the grid when you add an editor mount.

## The connection model (`src/lib/config.js`)

There is exactly ONE data path: the app always talks to real `kgsm-api`(s). There
are no fixtures and no mode switch. The only state distinction is **whether any
host is connected**, derived at module-load from `CONNECTIONS`:

- **≥1 connection** (a non-empty localStorage registry, or a `VITE_API_BASE`
  *seed*) → normal operation against the real backend(s).
- **0 connections** → the "connect a host" screen (`AddHostPage`), the entry point
  where you point the SPA at a kgsm-api.

`VITE_API_BASE` is an OPTIONAL single-host **seed** (a dev shortcut and how
`smoke` points the app at a backend), not a gate. `CONNECTIONS` is seeded once at
module load and then **grows in place**: cluster discovery (`clusterStore.discover`,
started from `stores/boot.js`) asks any reachable node for the converged peer
roster and registers the nodes it names, so the SPA drives the **cluster's** node
set rather than the addresses this browser was pointed at by hand. The array
identity never changes, so every consumer that holds the import sees a new node at
once; `subscribeConnections()` notifies the pieces that hold per-connection
resources (the SSE registry opens a stream per new node and re-hydrates). Connect
and disconnect still do a **full page reload** — they change identity and auth, the
same way login/logout/session-loss do. An appended peer needs no reload.

Each host carries its own base URL + bearer, and **routing is exact**: `apiV1Of(hostId)`
resolves the connection with that backend id or fails — throwing in dev, returning
null in prod so the call is rejected — because answering from another node is worse
than not answering. The single exemption is **cold boot**: a lone connection whose id
`GET /hosts` hasn't reconciled yet answers to any id. The fan-out and the SSE registry
already hold the connection, so they address it directly (`apiV1ForConn` /
`streamUrlForConn`) instead of round-tripping through an id. Multi-host (N≥2) fan-out
+ merge are real but some paths are still partly stubbed (see `merge.js`, `WIRING.md`).
`CONNECTIONS.length` (0 → connect screen, \>1 → fan-out) is a topology check, NOT a
mode flag — don't reintroduce a `LIVE`/`MOCK` duality.

## The data layer (`src/lib/`)

Components never touch the API directly. The flow is:

```
component → useStore(domainStore)            (store.js / stores.js — reactive cache, React 18 useSyncExternalStore)
domainStore.refresh() → api.get/post/patch   (apiClient.js — the ONE backend seam)
   fetch → adapters.js → store
realtime: liveStream.js (fetch-based SSE — one primary stream per host + per-view dynamic streams) → adaptStreamMessage → same stores
```

- **`apiClient.js` is the single seam.** Every store stays empty until it fetches;
  **call sites only ever see `api`**. It also owns connection health
  (`connectionStore` = REST reachability → cold-start/banner; `realtimeStore` =
  per-host SSE stream state, driven by `liveStream` `onMode`), the cluster auth gate
  (`api.host(id)` with 401-retry/silent-renew), `fanOut` (multi-host roll-up),
  `reconnectHost`/`reconnectAll` (drive the per-host sockets). **The assistant is not on
  this seam** — see below.
- **`adapters.js` — the honesty boundary.** kgsm-api emits a narrow, HONEST
  model. A value the backend doesn't provide maps to
  `null`/`"unknown"`/`[]` — **NEVER to `0` or an invented default** (the
  ecosystem-wide "never fabricate a metric" invariant; the UI renders "—").
  Don't hardcode game/domain data the backend can serve — plumb it through.
- **`merge.js`** — pure per-host → aggregated roll-up (every row carries its
  owning host id; merge only unions/de-dups, never invents attribution).
- **A server has TWO names, and they are not interchangeable.** `id` is the engine's — immutable,
  unique, path-safe — and is the key for every route, keyed store, SSE join, fetch path, widget param
  and React key. `name` is the mutable display label, free text, **not unique**, and never blank (an
  unlabelled instance reads as its id, which `adaptServer` guarantees with `be.name ?? be.id`). Render
  `name` wherever a person reads which server this is; pass `id` wherever something has to find it
  again. Where two servers could collide or identity is the point — the hero, the Identity card, the
  palette's rows — show BOTH, the id as secondary monospace. A rename arrives as an ordinary
  `server.patch` carrying a new `name`, so nothing needs invalidating: the row is patched in place and
  every surface re-renders. **Searching reads both**, because a person who knows an instance as
  `factorio-42` from a shell must still find it after somebody has labelled it "Sunday Server".
- **`assistantClient.js` + `assistantSession.js` — the SECOND seam, onto the assistant
  LEAF.** The assistant is a standalone service, so the chat talks to it **directly**, on
  the public origin the host's assistant capability reports (`info.url`), with a session
  the **leaf** issued — `kgsm-api` is not in the path of a turn, a confirmation, or a
  conversation read. `assistant.host(id)` mirrors `api.host(id)`'s shape (`conversations`,
  `turn`, `confirm`, …) against the leaf's own unprefixed routes. **A host that reports no
  public origin has no chat** (`ENOROUTE`, and the capability reads down) — it never falls
  back to kgsm-api's `/assistant/*` relay, which exists to reach a *peer* node's assistant
  and logs a warning when it serves the local one.

### Init-order: the lazy-import edges are deliberate

A few base-layer modules `import("...")`-lazily import upper ones (e.g.
`apiClient.js` defers `stores.js`/`sessionStore.js`/`alertsApi.js`). This keeps
the ESM graph **acyclic**. Converting one of these to a static `import` can reintroduce a cycle and
break boot. Read the comments before "tidying" an import.

## Auth, RBAC, capabilities

- **`sessionStore.js` — ONE session, for the whole cluster.** An account belongs to the cluster and
  so does the session it opens. The **anchor** — the member holding the `auth` capability — mints it
  and is the only thing that renews it; every other member accepts it by verifying the anchor's
  signature against the published key and resolves the tier from its own replica of the account
  store. **No member ever issues this browser a credential or extends one.** That is a rule, not an
  implementation detail: a member that could re-mint would be a second door to the same session on
  every machine in the cluster, permanently, in exchange for an outage largely shared with the
  panel's own ingress anyway.
  Two doors, both at the anchor: a username and password (`POST /auth/sign-in`, and `/auth/register`
  for a new account) and a provider bounce (`/auth/{provider}/start?prompt=consent` — the bare start
  is a silent attempt, which is right for a renewal behind somebody's back and wrong for a person
  who has just pressed Sign in). `authRedirect.js` captures the fragment handoff at boot and
  `establishClusterSession` is the adoption path both doors end in — it adopts the session FIRST,
  because the tokens are valid on their signature and nothing a member says makes them more so.
  The record carries `account` (`active｜pending｜unknown`) beside the tier, because a `none` tier is
  two facts: waiting on an admin, and holding nothing at all.
  **A tier is LIVE, not something learned once at sign-in.** A member pushes `{tier, status}` on the
  primary stream's `me` topic whenever the account is regraded, and that push is the authority — a
  demotion is written exactly like a promotion. Everything gated re-renders off the record write;
  `App.jsx` re-runs `resolveRoute` against the page the person is standing on, takes them home if
  they may no longer be there, and says once what their access now is.
  **A member's refusal is not the session's**, and this is the part that does not follow from a
  per-node model. A member verifies a signature offline but can only say what somebody MAY DO once
  its replica carries their account, so a member that has just joined refuses a perfectly good
  cluster session. `nodes` records who is currently honouring it, and the two refusals are separate
  claims: a **403** means the token validated and the person resolved to a tier too low (for an
  unknown account, `none`) — always about that member's view of this person, never about the
  session, so it is recorded at once; a **401** means the token itself did not validate, which is
  ambiguous until a renewal settles it, because a member still refusing a *fresh* session is not
  describing the session.
  **`components/AuthGate.jsx` is everything in front of the app** — the member screen, discovery,
  the one sign-in/register card, and the wait for approval — and `App.jsx` renders it *instead of*
  the shell, so none of the shell's hooks and none of the data layer run for somebody who has not
  signed in. A **pending** account is not carried by `sessionStore`: everything behind the gate
  would render for somebody entitled to none of it. The gate holds their session itself
  (`lib/authFlow.js`, sessionStorage) and polls `GET /me` — bare-authorized precisely so a tierless
  caller can ask — until an admin acts. A fresh registration and a first provider arrival land in
  exactly that state, so there is one screen for both.
- **`SettingsIdentities.jsx` — connected accounts, per host.** Which provider accounts are attached
  to the caller's own KGSM account, and attaching or detaching one. Both writes confirm the password
  first (`POST /auth/reauth`), asked BEFORE starting rather than after being refused; a fresh sign-in
  already counts, so the common path is never prompted. **The link flow is same-origin**: the start
  is an XHR (a bearer does not survive a top-level navigation) whose one-time ticket cookie the
  callback comes back with, and a cross-origin fetch does not store one. The callback returns to the
  configured frontend URL with `#linked=<provider>` or `#link_error=<code>`, which
  `oauthFragment.js` captures into a one-shot the section reports — and it rewrites the hash to
  `#/settings`, because the callback can only return to one address and landing on the dashboard
  after connecting an account tells nobody whether it worked.
- **`persona.js` — the authorization POLICY (single source of truth).** Roles are
  `admin｜operator｜viewer｜none`, and there is **one tier, cluster-wide** — the anchor resolves it
  and every member reads the same one from its own replica. So there is one question, `can(cap)`: a
  scoped variant would let a surface ask "may they do this *here*" and receive a cluster answer that
  only looks scoped, which is worse than not offering the question. Whether a MEMBER will honour
  that answer is a different fact and lives in `sessionStore.nodeRefusal(id)`.
  `resolveRoute()` is the **routing chokepoint**: a forbidden route is mapped to the persona's home
  synchronously, so it never enters state or mounts.
- **`assistantSession.js` — the session with the LEAF, separate from the node's, and obtained
  silently.** The assistant issues and revokes its own tokens, but every surface on a host is the
  **same Discord application** (one `KgsmAuth__Providers__discord__ClientId`, differing only in redirect URI), so a
  browser signed into the panel has already authorized the assistant: its round trip completes with
  `prompt=none`, rendering nothing. It is chained onto a panel login (already mid-redirect, so it
  costs nothing visible) and otherwise fires as soon as there is a targeted assistant host — which
  is what bounds it, since no assistant means nothing targeted and several means nothing targeted
  until the user picks. The return leg lands here carrying an **`assistant_login=<hostId>` marker
  in the query**; that marker is load-bearing, because both logins come back to this origin with
  the same `access`/`refresh`/`error` fragment keys and without it the panel hands a leaf token to
  kgsm-api and gets a 401. **One redirect per host per tab**, so a refusing leaf cannot loop the
  browser.
- **`capabilities.js` — per-host services** (metrics / assistant / watchdog), each
  with `provisioned` (offered?) × `status` (live health). **The assistant is
  per-host with no central fallback** — if a host doesn't expose it, that host has
  no assistant. An assistant whose capability names no public origin reads **down**,
  because the browser has nowhere to send a turn however healthy the leaf is.

## The shell (`App.jsx`)

Hash routing (`router.js`) — the URL is the source of truth (Back/Forward,
deep links, refresh all work). **Login/logout/session-loss do a full
`window.location.reload()` rather than swapping components in place** — this is
deliberate: several hooks live below the `!user` gate, so flipping `user` in
place would trip React's Rules of Hooks. Keep that pattern. Every server sub-tab
(Files, Settings, Performance, Players) is backed by a real endpoint; a value the
backend can't supply renders as "—" or its own honest not-measurable state, never
as a fabricated number.

**Notifications are two separate things here, and conflating them is the mistake
to avoid.** `<Toasts>` + the sidebar tray (`lib/toasts.js`) report the outcome of
something the **user just did**, in an open browser — they exist for the
shell-level handlers that own no control to render an error into, and a write path
with its own component keeps its inline error instead. **Web Push**
(`lib/push.js`, `pages/SettingsNotifications.jsx`, `public-panel/sw.js`) reports
what happened to the **fleet** while nothing was open, per device, opt-in, and
gated by both the host's rule and the person's own preference. Detail:
`components/CLAUDE.md`; the ecosystem-wide map, including how both relate to
kgsm-bot's Discord announcements, is in the workspace `CLAUDE.md`.

**There are TWO push surfaces, on two origins, and they are not interchangeable.**
The panel's is above. The standalone assistant's (`assistant/push.js`,
`assistant/SettingsPage.jsx`, `public-assistant/assistant-sw.js`) announces one
thing — an action the leaf staged and is waiting on you to approve — and it comes
from the **leaf**, with the leaf's own VAPID key. A subscription carries exactly
one application server key and belongs to one origin, so these can never share
one: the panel's worker is kgsm-api's and the assistant's is the leaf's, whatever
the browser. The browser mechanics they share live in `lib/pushBrowser.js`, which
takes its transport as a parameter and **imports nothing** — a shared module
reaching `apiClient` would fail `npm run check:assistant`.

## A component shows its data; it does not explain the system

**Never caption a reusable component with prose about how the system behind it works.** No footnote
saying where a node's queue is held, what a restart empties, that a run outlives the tab, or where
history lives instead. No empty-state subtitle restating the empty-state title in a sentence. No
sheet paragraph describing how work is paced. The site is not a tutorial on its own internals, and a
surface that has to caption itself to be understood has not been designed — the fix is the layout,
the label, or the data shown, never a paragraph underneath.

What a component *may* say in words is what it measured or was told: a count, a name, a verdict it
holds evidence for, a node that could not be read. The distinction is whether the sentence would
change if the data changed. *"1 node couldn't be read (DevTest)"* is data. *"A run keeps going
whether or not this tab is open"* is documentation, and belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or the CHANGELOG.

Assert the **absence**, not the presence. A no-prose rule is invisible to lint and to a build, and
the next edit that adds a helpful sentence will pass every gate. `scripts/smoke-live.mjs` and the
browser harnesses check the rendered component for explanatory phrasing and fail on it.

The **pin** is not prose and must survive any such removal. Where a surface is one card, the pin goes
in that card's `BriefCard` header and reveals on hover with the rest of the family
(`.chat-brief:hover .pin-btn`). Where it is not — the runs board — it sits on a row of its own
(`.opsq__head`), stays visible because nothing reveals it, and that row takes itself out of the
layout when the pin self-suppresses inside a widget.

## Styling & themes (`src/styles/`)

Plain CSS, no Tailwind/CSS-modules. Three files load in order (`main.jsx`):
`tokens.css` → `kit.css` → `consumer.css`. Everything is driven by the CSS custom
properties `tokens.css` defines — **a component must never hardcode a color; add
or extend a token.**

- **`tokens.css` — the design-token source of truth, split by concern:**
  - A plain `:root` holds **structural** tokens (type, spacing, radius, edge,
    shadow, motion, layout). Shadow/ring/edge tokens may reference color vars;
    `var()` is late-bound, so they pick up the active theme automatically.
    Most of these are invariant, but a closed subset — **the shape surface** —
    may be re-valued by a theme; the block's banner names it exactly.
  - **Borders are the elevation model here** (hairlines far outnumber shadows),
    so the whole shorthand is a token: `--edge` / `--edge-strong` /
    `--edge-accent`. Those are the OUTLINE OF A SURFACE; a one-sided
    `border-top`/`border-bottom` is a **divider**, keeps the longhand, and stays a
    hairline in every theme.
  - **Radii must go through `var(--r-*)`.** `--r-sm` and `--r-pill` carry the
    bulk of the kit's radius declarations, which is what makes corner geometry a
    one-line theme change. A literal `border-radius: 4px` is legal CSS and simply
    will not follow a theme.
  - **Color** tokens live in theme scopes: `:root, [data-theme="dark"]` (the
    default — applies with no attribute too) and `[data-theme="light"]`. Plus the
    overlay tokens: `--veil-1/2/3` (white-alpha
    surface fills that flip to black-alpha on light), `--scrim-base` (modal/drawer
    backdrop, consumed via `color-mix` so each site keeps its own alpha), and
    `--scrollbar-*`. **The contract: a theme = the FULL color set re-valued.**
    Canvas-fade gradients use `color-mix(in srgb, var(--canvas) X%, transparent)`
    so they track the theme with no extra token.
- **`kit.css` is a BARREL, not a file to edit.** It only `@import`s the focused
  per-domain partials under `src/styles/kit/` — read the barrel for the set and
  order. **Add a rule to the partial that owns
  the domain — do NOT grow a monolith.** Import **order is load-bearing**
  (later wins on equal specificity): keep the `@import` sequence; a new domain gets
  a new partial appended to the barrel. `@import` must precede other rules, which
  the imports-only barrel satisfies.
- **`consumer.css`** — a few consumer surfaces (connect/MOTD/login persona).

**Themes (`src/lib/theme.js`).** A client-only preference (`localStorage
krystal:theme` = `auto` or a concrete palette id from `THEME_OPTS`, default
`dark`) that NEVER round-trips to a
host — same model as favorites. `auto` resolves via `matchMedia` and live-updates
on OS change. Switching is **LIVE — no page reload** (swaps `<html data-theme>`,
which re-cascades instantly). **Both surfaces offer the same `<ThemePicker>` on a
Settings page** — the panel's under Profile, the standalone assistant's under
Appearance (`src/assistant/SettingsPage.jsx`, reached from the foot of the
conversation rail, or the header cog at phone width where that rail is hidden).
Landmines:
- **No-flash:** an inline boot script in `index.html` **and `assistant.html`** sets
  `data-theme` *before* the stylesheet applies. Both mirror `theme.js` — keep the
  three in sync.
- **Monaco can't read CSS vars** → `CodeEditor.jsx` samples the resolved tokens at
  runtime and re-themes (`vs`/`vs-dark`) whenever the theme store flips.
- **Always-dark media surfaces** (e.g. the cinematic server hero over key-art) pin
  the dark `--fg-*`/`--border-*`/`--*-fg` tokens **locally** so they stay
  light-on-dark in every theme — see `.hero--cinematic` in `kit/server.css`. Do
  that instead of per-theme special-casing.
- **Adding a theme:** add a `[data-theme="x"]` block (full color set) to
  `tokens.css`, then one entry in `theme.js`'s `THEME_OPTS` (id + label — `VALID`
  is derived from it, and every picker reads it), and the concrete-theme list in
  the `index.html` / `assistant.html` boot scripts, which cannot import.
- **The `cvd-*` colour-vision themes carry a measured guarantee** — status colours
  a stated ΔE2000 apart and every contrast floor held, *under a simulation of the
  deficiency each names*. Editing one of their tokens means re-running
  `node /home/heisen/tks/scripts/cvd-check/verify.mjs`, which re-measures the
  blocks straight out of `tokens.css`. A `THEME_OPTS` entry joins the pack by
  carrying a `cvd:` field naming who it is for; that field, not the id prefix, is
  what the pickers group and badge on. See `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.
- **The tribute themes quote a screen from somewhere else** — The Matrix, Windows
  95, Winamp, LCARS, Cyberpunk 2077, the DOS blue screen, the Commodore 64, PICO-8.
  Their colours are chosen for recognition, so where a source palette can't carry a
  status family the nearest colour from the SAME source is used and the deviation is
  named in the block's comment; a foreign hue smuggled in to make the ramp tidy is
  the one edit to refuse. A `THEME_OPTS` entry joins them by carrying a `tribute:`
  field naming what it quotes, which the pickers group on and show as the swatch's
  tooltip.
- **The tributes are also the only themes that re-value SHAPE** — corner radius,
  border weight, elevation, the UI font, transition durations. An upstream editor
  scheme never had an opinion about a corner; a tribute is quoting a whole
  interface, so the shape is part of the quotation. Win95, DOS Blue and the C64
  set every duration to `0ms` because nothing on those screens eased; LCARS
  triples the radius ladder because the elbow *is* the design. A `THEME_OPTS`
  entry declares it with a `shape:` field saying in words what changes, since a
  swatch cannot show a duration. The permitted token set is fixed — see the
  structural banner in `tokens.css`, and don't widen it without a reason.
- **`npm run check:tokens`** fails on any `var(--…)` that names a property nothing
  defines. That is silent otherwise: an undefined custom property goes
  invalid-at-computed-value-time, so a border falls back to `currentColor` and a
  radius computes to 0, forever, with no warning from CSS or the build.
- **A theme named after an upstream scheme ships that scheme's values unretouched**,
  including where they are low-contrast by design — Solarized and Nord both are.
  Only the palettes this repo invents (the tribute and colour-vision packs) are held
  to contrast floors. `src/styles/CLAUDE.md` has the split.
- **Test themes with the visual harness's `--theme <id>` flag** (jsdom smoke does
  NOT lay out CSS, so it can't catch a theme regression). It seeds `krystal:theme`
  with whatever id you give it, so any palette in `THEME_OPTS` can be shot.

## Where truth lives

- **`WIRING.md` is the authoritative front↔back contract** — endpoint/realtime/
  schema diffs + the sequenced wiring plan. `§8` is the slice ledger; consult it
  for what's wired vs. pending rather than trusting prose elsewhere. The realtime
  SSE protocol's authority is `kgsm-api/src/Api/Realtime/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Deferred, repo-wide:** TypeScript, a unit-test runner, a full Workbox
  **precache** (`vite-plugin-pwa`; the service workers cache on demand, not the
  whole build manifest), and parts of multi-host fan-out (see `merge.js`,
  `WIRING.md`).

## Version tracking

- **Version source:** the `"version"` field in `package.json`
- **Packaging reads it via `deploy/version.sh`** — `./deploy/version.sh` prints the declared version, `--pkgver` prints the pacman-safe form. A package never restates a version number; it asks for one.
- Bump the version whenever you make a user-facing change (new feature, bug fix, behaviour change). Patch for fixes, minor for new features, major for breaking changes.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` with a brief entry for every meaningful change.
- A git tag matching the new version should be created on release: `git tag v<version>`.

## Documentation & comments: present-tense canon only

Prose in this repo — every doc, `README`/`CLAUDE.md` section, and in-code comment — describes
**how the thing works right now**, nothing else. History lives in the `CHANGELOG` and git
history; never duplicate it into docs or code.

- **No transitions.** Never "was X, now Y", "used to…", "changed from…", "no longer…", or any
  before/after framing. State the current rule flat: a sentence that only makes sense to a reader
  who knows what the code *used to* do is dead weight, because that "before" no longer exists
  anywhere in the code.
- **Tombstones leave no marker.** When something is removed — dying naturally as part of the work,
  or explicitly asked to be deleted — the removal is silent: no *"removed X"*, no *"X is gone"*,
  no *"deprecated, use Y instead"* pointing at a corpse. The prose reads as if it never was. Code
  kept while the thing that justified it was deleted gets a live present-tense reason to exist —
  or goes too.
- **No residue of the active work.** References only meaningful *during* a piece of work don't
  survive it: *"temporary shim for the rework"*, *"added to satisfy the new requirement"*,
  milestone/phase labels (*"per M2"*, *"the Phase 1 step"*). If a line's justification is the work
  that produced it rather than the system as it now stands, it goes.
- **No volatile numbers.** Counts and versions that drift — how many projects/files/tests/
  partials exist, a dependency's pinned version, a file's line count — never go in prose: they are
  stale the moment anything changes, and nothing fails to remind anyone. Name the authoritative
  source instead (the csproj, the directory, the barrel file). A number belongs in prose only when
  it *is* the contract (a port, a timeout, a cap) or a measured fact that is itself the reason a
  design exists.
- **Edits are replacements, not appends.** When changing an existing feature, rewrite the affected
  doc/comment fresh as if writing it for the first time — never append a correction under the
  stale version, and never leave the stale version standing beside the new. The current revision
  does not converse with prior revisions.

A reader six months from now should learn the system from the doc without knowing what it
replaced. If you catch yourself explaining a change, stop — that sentence belongs in the commit
message. When touching prose that already violates this, rewrite it to present-tense canon in
passing.
